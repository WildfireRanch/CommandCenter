# Continue: Files Tab Testing

## üìç Current State

**Session 018C Complete!** ‚úÖ
- All backend sync improvements deployed and working
- 15 files successfully synced from Google Drive:
  - **7 Google Docs** (including "test" file in CONTEXT folder)
  - **7 PDFs** (SolarShack equipment manuals)
  - **1 Google Sheet** (Wildfire.Green Financial Model)
- Smart sync verified working (detects new, changed, and unchanged files)
- Authentication auto-redirect implemented
- All timestamps showing in Mountain Time (Salt Lake City)

## üéØ Next Task: Files Tab Testing

Following the **[SESSION_018B_TESTING_GUIDE.md](docs/SESSION_018B_TEST_RESULTS.md)** test plan, we need to verify the **Files Tab** displays all synced documents correctly.

### What to Test

Navigate to the KB Dashboard **Files Tab** and verify:

#### 1. File Display
- [ ] All 15 synced files are visible
- [ ] Files are grouped by folder (CONTEXT, SolarShack, Wildfire.Green)
- [ ] Each file shows correct name
- [ ] File types are distinguishable (Google Doc, PDF, Sheet)
- [ ] Last synced timestamps show in Mountain Time

#### 2. Context File Badges
- [ ] Files in CONTEXT folder show "Context File" badge
- [ ] Badge styling is clear and visible
- [ ] Non-context files don't have the badge

#### 3. Folder Grouping
- [ ] **CONTEXT** folder shows 5 files:
  - context-bret
  - context-commandcenter
  - context-miner
  - context-solarshack
  - test
- [ ] **SolarShack** folder shows 9 files:
  - 2 Google Docs
  - 7 PDFs (equipment manuals)
- [ ] **Wildfire.Green** folder shows 1 file:
  - Financial Model (Google Sheet)

#### 4. File Metadata
- [ ] Token counts display correctly
- [ ] MIME types show correctly:
  - `application/vnd.google-apps.document` for Google Docs
  - `application/pdf` for PDFs
  - `application/vnd.google-apps.spreadsheet` for Sheets
- [ ] No sync errors displayed
- [ ] Created/Updated timestamps present

#### 5. UI/UX
- [ ] Files are easy to scan and read
- [ ] Folder sections are visually distinct
- [ ] Responsive design works on different screen sizes
- [ ] Loading states handle gracefully
- [ ] Empty states (if any) display properly

### Expected API Response

The `/kb/documents` endpoint should return all 15 files with this structure:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "documents": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "google_doc_id": "...",
      "title": "context-bret",
      "folder": "CONTEXT",
      "folder_path": "CONTEXT",
      "mime_type": "application/vnd.google-apps.document",
      "is_context_file": true,
      "token_count": 1234,
      "last_synced": "2025-10-08T...",
      "sync_error": null,
      "created_at": "2025-10-08T...",
      "updated_at": "2025-10-08T..."
    },
    // ... 14 more files
  ],
  "count": 15
}
```

### Known Issues to Watch For

Based on Session 018C work, watch for:

1. **MIME type not displaying**: We added `mime_type` column recently, ensure it's populated
2. **Timezone display**: Verify timestamps use `America/Denver` timezone
3. **Missing folder_path**: Verify folder grouping works with new `folder_path` column
4. **Context file detection**: Ensure `is_context_file` flag is set correctly for CONTEXT folder files

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Test the documents endpoint directly
curl https://api.wildfireranch.us/kb/documents | jq

# Check specific file counts
curl https://api.wildfireranch.us/kb/documents | jq '.count'

# Filter by folder
curl https://api.wildfireranch.us/kb/documents | jq '.documents[] | select(.folder == "CONTEXT")'

# Check mime types
curl https://api.wildfireranch.us/kb/documents | jq '[.documents[] | .mime_type] | unique'
```

## üìã Test Checklist

Use this checklist as you test:

- [ ] Navigate to https://your-vercel-domain.vercel.app/kb
- [ ] Click on **Files** tab
- [ ] Count total files displayed (should be 15)
- [ ] Verify CONTEXT folder shows 5 files with badges
- [ ] Verify SolarShack folder shows 9 files (2 Docs, 7 PDFs)
- [ ] Verify Wildfire.Green folder shows 1 file (Sheet)
- [ ] Check that file types are visually distinguishable
- [ ] Verify timestamps are in Mountain Time
- [ ] Test responsive design on mobile/tablet sizes
- [ ] Check for any console errors in browser dev tools

## üêõ If Issues Found

Document any issues with:
1. **What's wrong**: Specific description of the problem
2. **Expected behavior**: What should happen
3. **Actual behavior**: What's actually happening
4. **Screenshots**: If helpful
5. **Console errors**: Any JavaScript errors in browser console
6. **Network errors**: Any failed API calls in Network tab
