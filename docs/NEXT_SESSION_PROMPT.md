# Next Session Prompt - Session 009

Copy and paste this to start your next session with Claude:

Hi Claude! Continuing work on **CommandCenter** - Session 009.

## Where We Left Off (Session 008 - Oct 5, 2025)

**MAJOR WINS:** ðŸŽ‰
- âœ… **Agent has memory!** Recalls past conversations automatically
- âœ… **Multi-turn dialogue** works (using session_id)
- âœ… **Energy data persistence** - SolArk snapshots saved to TimescaleDB
- âœ… **Historical tracking** - Can query past energy data

**What's Working:**
- API: https://api.wildfireranch.us (healthy, 9 endpoints)
- Agent: Solar Controller with conversation memory
- Database: PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB on Railway
- Memory: Agent recalls past 3 conversations in context

**Test Evidence:**
```
User: "What was my battery in our first conversation?"
Agent: "Your battery was 18% in our first conversation..." âœ… REMEMBERED!
```

## Session 009 Goal: Build MCP Server ðŸš€

**Objective:** Deploy MCP server to Vercel so I can use my CommandCenter agent directly from Claude Desktop.

**What We Need to Build:**
1. Create MCP server project (Model Context Protocol)
2. Connect to Railway database (reuse existing connection)
3. Expose agent capabilities via MCP interface
4. Deploy to Vercel
5. Configure Claude Desktop to connect
6. Test end-to-end integration

**Estimated Time:** 45-60 minutes

## Context

**Repository:** https://github.com/WildfireRanch/CommandCenter
**Documentation:** All docs in `/docs`, session summaries in `/docs/sessions/`
**Latest Session:** Session 008 - Agent Memory and Energy Tracking

**Current Stack:**
- Backend: FastAPI on Railway
- Database: PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB on Railway
- Agent: CrewAI (Solar Controller)
- Frontend: None (this is what MCP solves!)

**Environment:**
- DATABASE_URL: Railway reference variable (already configured)
- OPENAI_API_KEY: Configured
- SOLARK_EMAIL/PASSWORD: Configured

## Expected Deliverables

1. **MCP Server Code:**
   - Project structure in `/vercel/` or `/mcp/`
   - MCP protocol implementation
   - Database connection to Railway
   - Agent integration

2. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy to Vercel
   - Environment variables configured
   - Health check working

3. **Claude Desktop Config:**
   - Configuration file for Claude Desktop
   - Instructions to test

4. **Documentation:**
   - Session 009 summary
   - MCP setup guide
   - Updated progress.md

## Resources

**MCP Documentation:**
- https://modelcontextprotocol.io/
- MCP SDK: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers

**Vercel Deployment:**
- Serverless functions
- Environment variables
- Python runtime

## My Question

I'm ready to build the MCP server! Let's make my CommandCenter agent accessible directly from Claude Desktop. Where should we start? ðŸš€

**Note:** I prefer step-by-step guidance and clear documentation as we go.
