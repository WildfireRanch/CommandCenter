# Session 008 - Quick Summary

**Date:** October 5, 2025
**Duration:** ~60 minutes
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE - TWO MAJOR FEATURES SHIPPED

---

## What We Built

### 1. Energy Data Persistence âš¡
- **Auto-save** SolArk data to TimescaleDB on every query
- **3 new API endpoints** for historical data
- **Time-series tracking** of battery, solar, load, grid

### 2. Agent Memory System ðŸ§ 
- **Agent recalls** past 3 conversations automatically
- **Multi-turn dialogue** using session_id
- **Cross-session memory** - remembers even without session_id

---

## Key Test Results

**Memory Test:**
```
1. "What is my battery SOC?" â†’ "18%"
2. "How does that compare to earlier?"
   â†’ "Was 18%, now 19%. Solar was 6403W, now 8687W" âœ… REMEMBERED!
3. "What was my battery in our first conversation?"
   â†’ "Your battery was 18%..." âœ… RECALLED!
```

**Energy Data:**
```
GET /energy/latest â†’ Most recent snapshot
GET /energy/recent?hours=24 â†’ Time-series data
GET /energy/stats?hours=24 â†’ Avg/min/max analytics
```

## System Status ðŸŸ¢

**Live API:** https://api.wildfireranch.us

**Capabilities:**
- âœ… 9 API endpoints operational
- âœ… Agent has conversation memory
- âœ… Multi-turn conversations work
- âœ… Historical energy tracking
- âœ… Database: 5+ conversations, 2+ energy snapshots

**V1 Scope Progress:**
- Hardware Control: 80% (SolArk âœ…, Shelly pending, Miners pending)
- Energy Orchestrator: 50% (Data collection âœ…, automation pending)
- Conversation Interface: 95% (API âœ…, Memory âœ…, Frontend pending)
- Basic Knowledge Base: 0% (not started)
- Simple Memory: 80% (Storage âœ…, Retrieval âœ…, Vector search pending)

## What's Next

### Recommended: MCP Server (Session 009)
**Time:** 45-60 minutes
**Goal:** Use agent from Claude Desktop
**Why:** Immediate usability, professional integration

### Alternative: Frontend UI
**Time:** 90-120 minutes
**Goal:** Web interface for agent
**Why:** Visual dashboard, shareable
