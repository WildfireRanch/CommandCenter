Please walk through and document:

1. **Backend API (Railway):**
   - What endpoints exist in railway/src/api/main.py?
   - What agents exist in railway/src/agents/?
   - What tools exist in railway/src/tools/?
   - What KB endpoints exist?
   - Database schema - what tables?

2. **Frontend (Vercel):**
   - What pages exist in vercel/src/app/?
   - What components in vercel/src/components/?
   - How is KB integrated?
   - What's the chat interface like?

3. **Database:**
   - Check railway/src/utils/db.py - what functions?
   - What's the schema initialization look like?

4. **Configuration:**
   - Environment variables used
   - API keys needed
   - Railway vs Vercel deployment configs

Create a markdown file: `docs/CODEBASE_AUDIT_OCT2025.md` with findings.

---

## **Session 2: Energy Orchestrator Agent** (6-8 hours)

### Part 1: Design the Agent (1 hour)

**Instructions for Claude Code:**
```
Claude Code, I need to create a new agent: Energy Orchestrator

Requirements:
- Plans energy actions based on SOC, time, weather
- Coordinates with Solar Controller agent
- Makes decisions about miner usage
- Optimizes battery charging/discharging
- Can pause/resume miners during low energy

Create a design document first: docs/ENERGY_ORCHESTRATOR_DESIGN.md

Include:
1. Agent role and backstory
2. Tools needed (what actions can it take?)
3. Integration with Solar Controller
4. Decision-making logic
5. Safety guardrails

Reference the old Relay stack docs if helpful for concepts.
```

**Review the design together before building**

---

### Part 2: Build Required Tools (2-3 hours)

**Instructions for Claude Code:**
```
Claude Code, based on the design doc, create these tools:

1. **Battery Optimizer Tool** (railway/src/tools/battery_optimizer.py)
   - Input: Current SOC, time of day, weather forecast
   - Output: Recommended charge/discharge action
   - Logic: Prioritize battery during peak rates, charge during off-peak

2. **Miner Coordinator Tool** (railway/src/tools/miner_coordinator.py)
   - Input: Available power, current load
   - Output: Miner on/off recommendations
   - Logic: Pause miners when SOC < 40%, resume when SOC > 60%

3. **Energy Planner Tool** (railway/src/tools/energy_planner.py)
   - Input: 24-hour forecast, current state
   - Output: Hour-by-hour action plan
   - Logic: Optimize for cost and battery health

Each tool should:
- Have @tool decorator
- Include dry_run mode
- Have clear docstrings
- Return structured data
- Log all decisions

Test each tool individually before integration.
```

---

### Part 3: Create the Agent (2 hours)

**Instructions for Claude Code:**
```
Claude Code, create the Energy Orchestrator agent:

File: railway/src/agents/energy_orchestrator.py

Based on CrewAI patterns, create an agent with:

1. **Role:** "Energy System Planner and Coordinator"

2. **Backstory:** 
   "You are responsible for optimizing energy usage at a solar-powered 
   off-grid ranch. You coordinate between the solar controller, battery 
   system, and bitcoin miners to maximize efficiency while ensuring 
   reliable power. You make decisions based on current SOC, time of day, 
   weather forecasts, and operational priorities."

3. **Tools:**
   - battery_optimizer
   - miner_coordinator  
   - energy_planner
   - KB search (for learning operational procedures)

4. **Integration:**
   - Can delegate to Solar Controller agent
   - Receives queries from main orchestration layer
   - Logs all decisions to database

5. **Safety:**
   - Never discharge battery below 20%
   - Always confirm before major changes
   - Dry-run mode by default for new actions

Follow the same pattern as solar_controller.py but adapt for orchestrator role.
```

---

### Part 4: Test & Deploy (1-2 hours)

**Instructions for Claude Code:**
```
Claude Code, let's test the Energy Orchestrator:

1. **Unit Test Each Tool:**
   - Test battery_optimizer with various SOC levels
   - Test miner_coordinator with different power scenarios
   - Test energy_planner with sample forecasts

2. **Test Agent Integration:**
   - Ask it: "What's the energy plan for today?"
   - Ask it: "Should we run the miners right now?"
   - Ask it: "Optimize battery charging for tonight"

3. **Test Agent Coordination:**
   - Ask a question that requires both Solar Controller and Orchestrator
   - Example: "Check solar status and create an energy plan"

4. **Deploy to Railway:**
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add: Energy Orchestrator agent with planning tools"
   git push

5. **Verify in production:**
   - Check Railway deployment logs
   - Test via API endpoint
   - Verify database logging

Create: docs/ENERGY_ORCHESTRATOR_TESTING.md with results
```

---

## **Session 3: Frontend Polish & Final Testing** (4-6 hours)

### Part 1: Improve Chat Interface (2-3 hours)

**Instructions for Claude Code:**
```
Claude Code, let's polish the chat interface:

File: vercel/src/components/ChatInterface.tsx (or wherever it is)

Improvements needed:

1. **Show Agent Status:**
   - Display which agent is responding
   - Show "thinking..." indicator
   - Show "searching knowledge base..." when KB queried

2. **Display Sources:**
   - When agent cites KB sources, show them as clickable links
   - Format like: "According to [Solar Operations Manual] ..."
   - Add citation tooltip showing exact passage

3. **Better Message Display:**
   - User messages: right-aligned, blue background
   - Agent messages: left-aligned, grey background
   - Sources: below agent message, collapsible section

4. **Loading States:**
   - Skeleton loader while waiting
   - Typing indicator animation
   - Progress bar for long operations

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Clear error messages
   - Retry button for failed queries
   - Helpful suggestions for common errors

Reference modern chat UI patterns (like ChatGPT, Claude.ai) for UX.
```

---

### Part 2: Add Agent Selector (1 hour)

**Instructions for Claude Code:**
```
Claude Code, add an agent selector to the chat interface:

Dropdown or tabs to choose:
- Solar Controller (default)
- Energy Orchestrator  
- Both (auto-route based on query)

Store selection in state, pass to API endpoint.

Update API to handle agent selection:
- POST /ask with "agent": "solar" | "orchestrator" | "auto"
- Auto mode: Classify query and route to appropriate agent
```

---

### Part 3: End-to-End Testing (1-2 hours)

**Instructions for You + Claude Code:**

**Test Scenarios:**

1. **Solar Status Query:**
   - Ask: "What's the current solar system status?"
   - Expected: Solar Controller responds with current data

2. **KB Search Query:**
   - Ask: "What are the maintenance procedures for the solar panels?"
   - Expected: Agent searches KB, cites relevant documents

3. **Planning Query:**
   - Ask: "Should we run the miners tonight?"
   - Expected: Orchestrator analyzes SOC, weather, creates plan

4. **Multi-Agent Query:**
   - Ask: "Check solar status and create an energy plan for today"
   - Expected: Both agents coordinate, provide comprehensive response

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Ask an ambiguous question
   - Expected: Agent asks for clarification

6. **Memory Test:**
   - Ask: "What did we discuss about the solar system yesterday?"
   - Expected: Agent recalls previous conversation

**For each test:**
