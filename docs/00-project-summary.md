Agent Stack Migration - Complete Project Summary
Date: October 1, 2025
Status: Discovery Phase - Project Setup
Project Overview
Mission
Migrate existing agent/KB/doc stack to a modern, self-hosted architecture using:

Framework: CrewAI (MIT license, open source)
Platforms: Vercel (frontend/MCP) + Railway (backend services)
MCP Integration: Using Vercel's mcp-handler for Next.js
Development: GitHub Codespaces + Claude Code
GUI Tool: AutoGen Studio for prototyping

User Context

Technical background with limited coding skills
Solo developer wanting to own their stack
Values GUI/visual tools and clear documentation
Needs step-by-step guidance and good project management
Important: Starting fresh - selective porting from old repo, not copying everything

Key Decisions Made
1. Framework Selection: CrewAI
Finalists Considered:

CrewAI (MIT license)
Agno (performance-focused)
AutoGen (Microsoft-backed)
Google ADK (GCP-native)
PydanticAI (type-safe)

Winner: CrewAI

MIT license - 100% free, no vendor lock-in
Easy to use with role-based agent design
100,000+ certified developers in community
No dependencies on other frameworks
Self-hostable with no usage limits

2. Platform Selection: Vercel + Railway
Considered:

Vercel + Railway (chosen)
Google Cloud Platform
Pure self-hosted

Why Vercel + Railway:

300% faster cold starts vs GCP (Railway benchmark)
Simple, predictable pricing vs GCP complexity
Zero-configuration deployment
Excellent developer experience
Platform-agnostic - can migrate later if needed
Cost: ~$15-50/month to start vs ~$100+ for GCP

Cost Comparison:

Railway: $5/month base + pay-per-use
Vercel: $0-20/month (Hobby → Pro)
GCP: Complex billing with surprise charges

3. MCP Integration Strategy
Approach: Next.js + Vercel MCP Handler

Requires only a few lines of code
Deploy-ready templates available
Built-in AI SDK support
Streamable HTTP transport (50% less CPU usage)

4. GUI/Management Tool: AutoGen Studio
Why AutoGen Studio won:

Official Microsoft product (vs community CrewAI Studio)
True drag-and-drop interface
Declarative JSON - export to any framework
890,000+ downloads, active development
Can prototype visually, then export to CrewAI code

Workflow:

Build agents in AutoGen Studio (visual)
Test and iterate (no code)
Export to CrewAI when ready (code)
Deploy to production (Vercel/Railway)

5. Fresh Start Approach
Decision: Start with clean slate, selectively port from old repo

Avoid inheriting bugs and technical debt
Opportunity to rethink architecture
Document what's being brought over (and why)
Build on solid foundation
Audit → Rate (KEEP/REFACTOR/REWRITE/SKIP) → Port selectively

Session Protocol
Start: State type (planning/implementation), time available, goal
During: Share errors, ask when stuck, request breaks
End: Create summary, update progress, commit code, plan next session

Important Principles
DO:
✅ Start completely fresh
✅ Audit everything before porting
✅ Document all decisions
✅ Test each ported component
✅ Ask "do I really need this?"
✅ Use Claude Code for implementation
✅ Create session summaries
✅ Simplify when possible
DON'T:
❌ Copy entire old repo
❌ Port bugs from old system
❌ Rush the audit process
❌ Skip documentation
❌ Port components you don't understand
❌ Bring over unused code
❌ Use localStorage in artifacts
❌ Deploy without testing locally
Notes & Context

User hired Claude specifically for this project
Emphasis on GUI/visual tools due to limited coding skills
Need for clear documentation and step-by-step guidance
Solo project - no team dependencies
Open to learning but wants efficient implementation
Values owning the stack (no vendor lock-in)
Budget-conscious but willing to invest in right solution
Critical: Starting fresh to avoid technical debt
