## ðŸ“‹ Your Prompt for Next Session

Copy/paste this to Claude Code:

```
Please complete the Database Health Dashboard setup by running the database migration.

Instructions are in: docs/prompts/RUN_HEALTH_MONITORING_MIGRATION.md

You have Railway access to CommandCenterProject production environment.

Background:
- All code is implemented and deployed
- Health status endpoint is working: https://api.wildfireranch.us/health/monitoring/status
- We need to create the monitoring.health_snapshots table for historical data

Please:
1. Read the RAILWAY_ACCESS_GUIDE at the project root
2. Follow RUN_HEALTH_MONITORING_MIGRATION.md to execute the SQL
3. Verify the history endpoint works after migration
4. Confirm first health snapshot is collected
