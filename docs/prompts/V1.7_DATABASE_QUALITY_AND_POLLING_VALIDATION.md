## 📋 Validation Checklist

### PHASE 1: Database Schema Validation (15-20 min)

#### Step 1.1: Verify SolArk Schema
**What to check:**
- `solark.plant_flow` table exists and has data
- Check table structure and indexes
- Verify data retention period
- Check for missing or NULL values

**Commands:**
```bash
# Connect to database
railway run psql

# Check schema exists
\dn

# Check table structure
\d solark.plant_flow

# Check data count and date range
SELECT
    COUNT(*) as total_records,
    MIN(created_at) as oldest_record,
    MAX(created_at) as newest_record,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours') as records_last_24h,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days') as records_last_7d
FROM solark.plant_flow;

# Check for data gaps in last 24 hours
SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('hour', created_at) as hour,
    COUNT(*) as record_count,
    AVG(pv_power) as avg_solar,
    AVG(load_power) as avg_load,
    AVG(soc) as avg_soc
FROM solark.plant_flow
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('hour', created_at)
ORDER BY hour DESC;

# Check for NULL values
SELECT
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE pv_power IS NULL) as null_pv_power,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE batt_power IS NULL) as null_batt_power,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE load_power IS NULL) as null_load_power,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE grid_power IS NULL) as null_grid_power,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE soc IS NULL) as null_soc
FROM solark.plant_flow
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';
```

**Expected Results:**
- Table should exist in `solark` schema
- Should have data from last 24 hours minimum
- Records should be relatively continuous (not huge gaps)
- No excessive NULL values in critical columns

**Questions to Answer:**
- [ ] How many records exist in total?
- [ ] What's the oldest record date?
- [ ] How frequently is data being collected? (records per hour)
- [ ] Are there any significant gaps in data collection?
- [ ] What percentage of records have NULL values?

---

#### Step 1.2: Verify Victron Schema
**What to check:**
- `victron` schema exists
- `victron.battery_readings` table exists
- `victron.polling_status` table exists
- Check if Victron poller is running

**Commands:**
```bash
# Check if victron schema exists
SELECT schema_name
FROM information_schema.schemata
WHERE schema_name = 'victron';

# Check if tables exist
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'victron';

# If victron.battery_readings exists, check data
SELECT
    COUNT(*) as total_records,
    MIN(timestamp) as oldest_record,
    MAX(timestamp) as newest_record,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours') as records_last_24h
FROM victron.battery_readings;

# Check polling status (if table exists)
SELECT * FROM victron.polling_status WHERE id = 1;

# Check recent battery readings
SELECT
    timestamp,
    soc,
    voltage,
    current,
    power,
    temperature,
    state
FROM victron.battery_readings
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Expected Results:**
- Schema may or may not exist (V1.7 works without it)
- If exists, should have recent data (< 3 minutes old)
- `polling_status` should show `is_healthy = true`

**Questions to Answer:**
- [ ] Does the Victron schema exist?
- [ ] If yes, how many battery readings exist?
- [ ] Is the Victron poller healthy and running?
- [ ] How frequently is Victron data collected?
- [ ] Are there discrepancies between Victron SOC and SolArk SOC?

**Action Items if Victron Missing:**
- [ ] Initialize Victron schema: `curl -X POST https://api.wildfireranch.us/db/init-schema`
- [ ] Check if Victron poller service is running
- [ ] Verify Victron API credentials are set
- [ ] Start Victron poller if not running

---

#### Step 1.3: Check TimescaleDB Configuration
**What to check:**
- TimescaleDB extension is enabled
- Hypertables are configured
- Retention policies are active

**Commands:**
```bash
# Check TimescaleDB extension
SELECT * FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'timescaledb';

# Check which tables are hypertables
SELECT
    hypertable_schema,
    hypertable_name,
    num_chunks,
    compression_enabled
FROM timescaledb_information.hypertables;

# Check retention policies
SELECT
    hypertable_name,
    proc_name,
    config,
    scheduled
FROM timescaledb_information.jobs
WHERE proc_name = 'policy_retention';

# Check data retention is working (solark)
SELECT
    DATE(created_at) as date,
    COUNT(*) as records
FROM solark.plant_flow
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC
LIMIT 30;
```

**Expected Results:**
- TimescaleDB extension should be installed
- `solark.plant_flow` should be a hypertable
- `victron.battery_readings` should be a hypertable (if exists)
- Retention policy should be set for Victron (72 hours)

**Questions to Answer:**
- [ ] Is TimescaleDB properly configured?
- [ ] Are tables set up as hypertables for performance?
- [ ] Is data being automatically deleted per retention policies?
- [ ] How many days of SolArk data are being retained?

### PHASE 2: Data Collection Validation (20-30 min)

#### Step 2.1: SolArk Polling Mechanism
**What to check:**
- Identify how SolArk data is being collected
- Check polling frequency
- Validate data freshness
- Check for polling errors

**Commands:**
```bash
# Check latest SolArk data timestamp
SELECT
    MAX(created_at) as last_record,
    NOW() - MAX(created_at) as age_of_last_record,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '5 minutes') as records_last_5min
FROM solark.plant_flow;

# Check polling consistency over last hour
SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('minute', created_at) as minute,
    COUNT(*) as record_count
FROM solark.plant_flow
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('minute', created_at)
ORDER BY minute DESC
LIMIT 60;

# Check for duplicate timestamps (shouldn't have many)
SELECT
    created_at,
    COUNT(*) as duplicate_count
FROM solark.plant_flow
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY created_at
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY duplicate_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Check Backend Logs:**
```bash
# If running locally
cd railway
tail -f logs/app.log | grep -i "solark"

# Or check Railway deployment logs
# Look for patterns like:
# - "solark_poll_success"
# - "solark_poll_failed"
# - Error messages
```

**Questions to Answer:**
- [ ] How frequently is SolArk data collected? (every 30s? 1min? 5min?)
- [ ] When was the last successful poll?
- [ ] Are there consistent gaps in polling?
- [ ] What triggers SolArk data collection? (cron? webhook? API call?)
- [ ] Where is the SolArk poller code located?

**Files to Check:**
- Look for: `solark_poller.py`, `solark_scheduler.py`, or similar
- Check: `railway/src/services/`
- Check: `railway/src/integrations/`
- Check: Cron jobs or scheduled tasks

---

#### Step 2.2: Victron Polling Mechanism
**What to check:**
- Identify Victron poller service
- Check if it's running
- Validate polling frequency (should be ~3 minutes per API limits)
- Check for rate limiting issues

**Commands:**
```bash
# Check Victron health endpoint
curl -s "https://api.wildfireranch.us/victron/health" | jq

# Check latest Victron data
curl -s "https://api.wildfireranch.us/victron/battery/current" | jq

# Manually trigger a poll (for testing)
curl -X POST "https://api.wildfireranch.us/victron/poll-now" | jq

# Check database polling status
SELECT
    last_poll_attempt,
    last_successful_poll,
    consecutive_failures,
    is_healthy,
    requests_this_hour,
    last_error
FROM victron.polling_status
WHERE id = 1;
```

**Check for Poller Service:**
```bash
# Find Victron poller code
find railway/src -name "*victron*" -type f

# Check if poller is running as a service
# Look for background service or cron job
```

**Questions to Answer:**
- [ ] Is the Victron poller service running?
- [ ] When was the last successful poll?
- [ ] How many API requests have been made this hour? (limit: 50/hour)
- [ ] Are there consecutive failures?
- [ ] What's the last error message (if any)?
- [ ] Is the poller respecting rate limits?

**Expected Polling Pattern:**
- Should poll every ~3 minutes (20 times per hour)
- Should stay well under 50 requests/hour limit
- Should show `is_healthy: true` in polling_status

---

#### Step 2.3: Data Quality Checks
**What to check:**
- Validate data ranges make sense
- Check for anomalies
- Compare Victron vs SolArk SOC accuracy

**Commands:**
```bash
# Check for unrealistic values (last 24h)
SELECT
    MIN(pv_power) as min_solar,
    MAX(pv_power) as max_solar,
    MIN(soc) as min_soc,
    MAX(soc) as max_soc,
    MIN(load_power) as min_load,
    MAX(load_power) as max_load
FROM solark.plant_flow
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';

# Check SOC comparison (if Victron exists)
SELECT
    s.created_at,
    s.soc as solark_soc,
    v.soc as victron_soc,
    ABS(s.soc - v.soc) as soc_difference
FROM solark.plant_flow s
LEFT JOIN LATERAL (
    SELECT soc, timestamp
    FROM victron.battery_readings
    WHERE timestamp BETWEEN s.created_at - INTERVAL '1 minute' AND s.created_at + INTERVAL '1 minute'
    ORDER BY ABS(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (timestamp - s.created_at)))
    LIMIT 1
) v ON true
WHERE s.created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY soc_difference DESC
LIMIT 10;

# Check for flatlined data (could indicate poller stuck)
SELECT
    pv_power,
    COUNT(*) as consecutive_count
FROM solark.plant_flow
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY pv_power
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10
ORDER BY consecutive_count DESC;
```

**Questions to Answer:**
- [ ] Are solar power values realistic? (0-10kW range typical)
- [ ] Are SOC values between 0-100%?
- [ ] Is battery power reasonable? (typical: -5kW to +5kW)
- [ ] Do Victron and SolArk SOC values align? (within 2-5% is normal)
- [ ] Are there flatlined values suggesting poller issues?

# All should complete in < 2 seconds
```

**Database Performance:**
```sql
-- Check query plans for slow queries
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT
    DATE(created_at) as date,
    SUM(pv_power) / 60000.0 as total_solar_kwh
FROM solark.plant_flow
WHERE DATE(created_at) >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at);

-- Check index usage
SELECT
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    indexname,
    idx_scan,
    idx_tup_read,
    idx_tup_fetch
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
WHERE schemaname IN ('solark', 'victron')
ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;
```

**Questions to Answer:**
- [ ] Are all endpoints responding in < 2 seconds?
- [ ] Are database indexes being used effectively?
- [ ] Are there any slow queries that need optimization?
- [ ] Is TimescaleDB providing performance benefits?

### PHASE 6: Data Integrity & Edge Cases (10-15 min)

#### Step 6.1: Edge Case Testing
**What to test:**
- Handling of zero/null values
- Behavior during nighttime (no solar)
- Behavior during high load events
- Behavior during battery full/empty

**Test Cases:**
```bash
# Test 1: Query future dates (should return no data)
FUTURE_DATE=$(date -d '7 days' +%Y-%m-%d)
curl -s "https://api.wildfireranch.us/energy/analytics/cost?start_date=$FUTURE_DATE&end_date=$FUTURE_DATE" | jq '.status'

# Test 2: Query with invalid parameters
curl -s "https://api.wildfireranch.us/energy/history?hours=99999" | jq '.status'
curl -s "https://api.wildfireranch.us/energy/analytics/daily?days=-5" | jq '.status'

# Test 3: Check nighttime data (no solar)
SELECT
    created_at,
    pv_power,
    load_power,
    soc
FROM solark.plant_flow
WHERE EXTRACT(HOUR FROM created_at) BETWEEN 22 AND 6
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

# Test 4: Check division by zero handling
SELECT
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE total_solar_kwh = 0) as days_with_zero_solar
FROM (
    SELECT
        DATE(created_at) as date,
        SUM(pv_power) / 60000.0 as total_solar_kwh
    FROM solark.plant_flow
    GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
) subquery;
```

**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Invalid parameters return proper error messages
- [ ] Nighttime data (zero solar) doesn't break calculations
- [ ] Division by zero is handled gracefully
- [ ] NULL values don't cause crashes
- [ ] Empty result sets return proper "no_data" status

## 🚨 Red Flags to Watch For

1. **Database Issues:**
   - Large gaps in data collection (> 30 min)
   - No data in last 24 hours
   - Excessive NULL values (> 10%)
   - Flatlined data (same value repeated 100+ times)

2. **Endpoint Issues:**
   - Response times > 5 seconds
   - Frequent 500 errors
   - Incorrect calculations (excess energy negative, SOC > 100%, etc.)
   - Missing data in responses

3. **Poller Issues:**
   - Victron poller not running or unhealthy
   - SolArk data not updating
   - Rate limit violations (> 50 requests/hour for Victron)
   - Consecutive failures > 5

4. **Data Quality Issues:**
   - SOC difference between Victron and SolArk > 10%
   - Solar power at night (> 100W between 10pm-6am)
   - Load power = 0 for extended periods
   - Battery charging when SOC = 100% for hours
