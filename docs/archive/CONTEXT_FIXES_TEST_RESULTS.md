routing_decision = json.loads(manager_result_str)

# Check if this is a routing decision
if routing_decision and routing_decision.get("action") == "route":
    target_agent = routing_decision.get("agent")

    # Route to appropriate specialist WITH context
    if target_agent == "Solar Controller":
        specialist_crew = create_energy_crew(
            query=request.message,
            conversation_context=context  # ← Context passed!
        )
```

**Status:** ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

def create_energy_crew(query: str, conversation_context: str = "") -> Crew:

# File: railway/src/agents/energy_orchestrator.py
def create_orchestrator_crew(query: str, context: str = "") -> Crew:
```

**Status:** ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

## Overall Assessment

### ✅ What's Working

1. **System Context Loading:**
   - Both specialist agents load context when created
   - Context is embedded in agent backstories
   - Clear formatting with section headers
   - Graceful fallback if no context files exist

2. **Routing Architecture:**
   - Manager tools return decisions (not execute)
   - Clean separation between routing and execution
   - No context loss in routing tools

3. **Context Flow:**
   - API properly parses routing decisions
   - Context explicitly passed to specialist crews
   - Both conversation AND system context flow properly

4. **Code Structure:**
   - All imports are correct
   - Function signatures accept context parameters
   - No structural issues found

### ⚠️ What Still Needs Testing

**These require a live environment with database:**

1. **Context File Retrieval:**
   - Need to verify `get_context_files()` returns valid content
   - Need KB documents with `is_context_file=TRUE`
   - Need to test with actual Google Drive CONTEXT folder

2. **End-to-End Flow:**
   - Test 1: "What system are you managing?"
   - Test 2: Multi-turn conversation continuity
   - Test 3: Policy knowledge without searching

3. **Performance:**
   - Token usage measurement
   - Response latency
   - Error rate

4. **Integration:**
   - Full API request/response cycle
   - Manager → Specialist routing
   - Context preservation across routing

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Deploying)

1. **✅ DONE:** Validate code structure (all tests passing)
2. **TO DO:** Deploy to environment with database access
3. **TO DO:** Verify KB has context files or sync from Google Drive
4. **TO DO:** Check database for documents with `is_context_file=TRUE`

### Testing in Live Environment

**Test Sequence:**

```bash
# 1. Check KB has context files
curl http://localhost:8000/kb/documents?is_context_file=true

# 2. Test system knowledge
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What system are you managing?"}'

# Expected: Should mention SolArk 15K, specific hardware

# 3. Test context continuity (multi-turn)
SESSION_ID=$(curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What'\''s my battery level?"}' | jq -r '.session_id')

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"message\": \"Is that good?\", \"session_id\": \"$SESSION_ID\"}"

# Expected: Should reference battery level from previous turn

# 4. Test policy knowledge
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What'\''s the minimum SOC?"}'

# Expected: Should answer immediately (30% or 40%), not search
```

### Monitoring After Deployment

**Metrics to Track:**

1. **Token Usage:**
   - Target: 5,000-8,000 tokens/query
   - Alarm: >10,000 tokens/query

2. **Response Latency:**
   - Target: 3-4 seconds
   - Alarm: >6 seconds

3. **Error Rate:**
   - Target: <5%
   - Watch for: JSON parsing failures, context loading errors

4. **Context Relevance:**
   - Measure: % responses correctly reference system context
   - Target: >90%

## Known Limitations

### Current State

1. **No Database Connection in Test Environment:**
   - Cannot test actual `get_context_files()` execution
   - Cannot verify context file content
   - Cannot test full end-to-end flow

2. **Code Structure Tests Only:**
   - Tests validate code is in place
   - Does not test runtime behavior
   - Does not test with real data

### When Deployed

1. **Context Loaded on Every Request:**
   - No caching yet (planned for future)
   - Database query every time agent created
   - Could be optimized later

2. **All Context Loaded:**
   - Not selective based on query
   - Loads all `is_context_file=TRUE` documents
   - Could be optimized with smart loading

3. **Two Crew Executions:**
   - Manager crew + Specialist crew
   - Slight latency increase
   - Could use hierarchical process later

git revert HEAD

# Or revert specific files
git checkout HEAD~1 railway/src/agents/solar_controller.py
git checkout HEAD~1 railway/src/agents/energy_orchestrator.py

## Success Criteria

These fixes are considered successful in production if:

✅ **Test 1: System Knowledge**
- Agent mentions specific hardware (SolArk 15K, 48kWh, etc.)
- Agent doesn't say "let me search..."
- Response time <5 seconds

✅ **Test 2: Context Continuity**
- Multi-turn: Second query references first response
- Agent doesn't ask "What are you asking about?"
- Context preserved across routing

✅ **Test 3: Policy Knowledge**
- Agent answers policies immediately (30% min SOC)
- No search_knowledge_base tool call needed
- Response includes "system policy" or similar

✅ **Performance:**
- Token usage: 5,000-8,000/query
- Latency: <5 seconds p95
- Error rate: <5%
