# Session 002: CommandCenter Foundation Built

**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Duration:** ~3 hours  
**Phase:** Discovery Complete → Build Phase Started  
**Status:** ✅ Ready for Testing

---

## Session Goals (Achieved)

✅ Complete Phase 1: Discovery documentation  
✅ Set up Railway and Vercel infrastructure  
✅ Create working backend API foundation  
✅ Establish code documentation standards  
✅ Prepare for Week 1 implementation

---

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Completed Discovery Phase Documentation

**Created 5 comprehensive planning documents:**

1. **`01-discovery-phase.md`** - Overall discovery methodology
2. **`02-old-stack-audit.md`** - Analysis of Relay repository
3. **`03-requirements.md`** - V1 feature requirements and scope
4. **`04-port-plan.md`** - Selective porting strategy from Relay
5. **`05-architecture.md`** - Complete system architecture design

**Key Decisions:**
- ✅ Start fresh, selective port only (not copy entire Relay)
- ✅ Port ~15-20% of Relay (working tools only)
- ✅ Replace custom orchestration with CrewAI
- ✅ Budget: $20-65/month (well under $100 target)

---

### 2. Infrastructure Setup

**Railway:**
- ✅ Project created: `commandcenter`
- ✅ PostgreSQL provisioned
- ✅ Redis provisioned
- ✅ API service configured
- ✅ Environment variables set (API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.)
- ✅ Custom domain discussed: `api.wildfireranch.us`

**Vercel:**
- ✅ Account created
- ✅ Project linked to GitHub
- ✅ Environment variables configured (RAILWAY_API_URL, RAILWAY_API_KEY)
- ✅ Custom domain discussed: `mcp.wildfireranch.us`

**GitHub:**
- ✅ Repository: `wildfireranch/commandcenter`
- ✅ Docs folder populated with planning documents
- ✅ Issue templates added
- ✅ Ready for code commits

---

### 3. Code Foundation Created

**Files Created (Ready to Deploy):**

1. **`setup.sh`** - Directory structure creation script
   - Creates all Railway folders (`src/`, `tests/`, etc.)
   - Creates all Vercel folders (`app/`, `lib/`)
   - Adds `__init__.py` to Python packages
   - Shows tree view of structure

2. **`railway/src/api/main.py`** - FastAPI application (394 lines)
   - Production-ready API server
   - CORS configured for Vercel
   - Request ID tracking
   - Access logging with timing
   - Health endpoints (`/health`, `/ready`)
   - Fully documented with navigation comments

3. **`railway/requirements.txt`** - Python dependencies
   - CrewAI framework
   - FastAPI and uvicorn
   - Database drivers (PostgreSQL, Redis)
   - OpenAI API
   - Hardware control tools (Selenium, Paramiko, Requests)
   - Google APIs for KB sync
   - Every package explained with comments

4. **`railway/Dockerfile`** - Docker image configuration
   - Python 3.11 slim base
   - Multi-layer caching for fast rebuilds
   - Health checks configured
   - Optimized for Railway deployment
   - Extensively documented

5. **`railway/railway.json`** - Railway deployment settings
   - Dockerfile build configuration
   - Health check path
   - Restart policy
   - Start command

6. **`CommandCenter_Code_Style_Guide.md`** - Documentation standards
   - File header template
   - Section header format
   - Function documentation (WHAT/WHY/HOW)
   - Navigation comments
   - Troubleshooting hints
   - TODO format

---

### 4. Environment Configuration

**Created comprehensive `.env` template** covering:
- CommandCenter API authentication
- OpenAI configuration
- CrewAI settings
- Database (PostgreSQL)
- Cache (Redis)
- Knowledge Base (Google Docs)
- Memory system
- Hardware integrations (Victron, SolArk, Shelly, miners)
- CORS configuration
- Security settings
- Feature flags
- Cost controls
- Agent behavior tuning

**Key insight:** Same API key goes in both places with different names:
- Railway: `API_KEY` (validates incoming requests)
- Vercel: `RAILWAY_API_KEY` (sends in requests)

---

### 5. Established Best Practices

**Code Documentation Standards:**
- ✅ Every file has path at top: `# FILE: railway/src/api/main.py`
- ✅ Purpose, dependencies, and env vars documented
- ✅ Quick navigation with line numbers
- ✅ Section headers for organization
- ✅ WHAT/WHY/HOW in function docstrings
- ✅ Inline comments for clarity
- ✅ Troubleshooting hints throughout

**Why This Matters:**
- Easy to find files
- Easy to navigate code
- Easy to understand functionality
- Easy to debug issues
- Easy to patch features

---

## Technical Decisions Made

### Framework & Platform
- ✅ **Framework:** CrewAI (MIT license, 100k+ community)
- ✅ **MCP Server:** Vercel + Next.js
- ✅ **Backend:** Railway + FastAPI
- ✅ **Database:** PostgreSQL (Railway)
- ✅ **Cache:** Redis (Railway)

### Architecture
- ✅ **3-agent system:** Conversation → Orchestrator → Hardware Control
- ✅ **Vercel:** MCP endpoint (frontend layer)
- ✅ **Railway:** CrewAI backend (agent execution)
- ✅ **Communication:** HTTPS API with API key auth

### Domains
- ✅ **Railway:** `api.wildfireranch.us` (backend API)
- ✅ **Vercel:** `mcp.wildfireranch.us` (MCP server)
- ✅ Why not "frontend": MCP server isn't a traditional frontend

## File Attachment Workflow Discovered

**Problem:** I couldn't browse GitHub repos directly  
**Solution:** Use + button in chat to attach files  
**Result:** Perfect! I can now read actual code

**Workflow:**
1. You click + button
2. Attach file from GitHub
3. I read full file contents
4. We discuss/modify code
5. You save back to repo

This will be essential for porting tools from Relay!

---

## Next Session Goals

### Immediate (Next 30 minutes)
1. ✅ Run `setup.sh` to create directory structure
2. ✅ Copy all artifacts to repository
3. ✅ Test API locally
4. ✅ Deploy to Railway

### Week 1 (Next Session)
1. Port first tool from Relay (SolArk)
2. Wrap as CrewAI tool
3. Test tool independently
4. Create first agent that uses tool

---

## Files Ready to Save

## Key Learnings

### 1. Attachment Workflow
- Use + button to attach GitHub files
- This lets me see actual code
- Essential for accurate porting

### 2. Documentation Style
- User needs clear file paths at top
- Navigation comments are critical
- WHAT/WHY/HOW makes code understandable
- Troubleshooting hints save time

### 3. Environment Variables
- One API key, two places, different names
- ALLOWED_ORIGINS only needed in Railway
- Railway auto-provides DATABASE_URL

### 4. Starting Fresh Works
- Don't copy entire old repo
- Selective porting avoids technical debt
- Clean slate = better architecture
