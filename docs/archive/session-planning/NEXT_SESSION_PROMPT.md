## Session Approach

**PLEASE GO SLOW AND EXPLAIN:**
- I learn best by doing, with clear explanations
- Show me examples and let me try
- Explain WHY we're doing things, not just HOW
- One step at a time, verify each step works
- If something doesn't work, help me debug it

**Hands-On Tutorial Format:**
1. You explain the concept
2. You show me the exact steps
3. I do it (you guide)
4. We verify it worked
5. We discuss what we learned
6. Move to next step

**Medium-term:**
- Automated daily solar reports
- Integration with existing SolArk data
