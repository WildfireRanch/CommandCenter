# Context Fixes Implementation Summary
**Date:** 2025-10-11
**Changes:** Implemented Fix #1 and Fix #2 from Deep Dive Analysis

---

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of two critical fixes to resolve context management issues in the CommandCenter V1.5 agent system.

**Problems Solved:**
1. Agents didn't know what system they were managing (no system context loaded)
2. Conversation context was lost when Manager routed to specialist agents

---

## Fix #1: Load System Context into Agent Backstories

### What Was Changed

**Files Modified:**
- `railway/src/agents/solar_controller.py` (lines 22, 207-269)
- `railway/src/agents/energy_orchestrator.py` (lines 127-192)

### Changes Made

#### 1. Solar Controller Agent (`solar_controller.py`)

**Added import:**
```python
from ..tools.kb_search import search_knowledge_base, get_context_files
```

**Modified `create_energy_monitor_agent()` function:**
```python
def create_energy_monitor_agent() -> Agent:
    # Load system context from knowledge base
    system_context = get_context_files()

    # Build backstory with system context
    backstory = """You are an expert energy systems analyst specializing in
    solar + battery installations. You monitor a SolArk inverter system and
    help the homeowner understand their energy production, consumption, and
    battery status. You communicate clearly with accurate numbers and helpful
    context. When asked about status, you always use the real-time tools to
    get current data - never guess or use old information.

    """

    # Add system context if available
    if system_context:
        backstory += f"""
═══════════════════════════════════════════
SYSTEM CONTEXT (Always Available)
═══════════════════════════════════════════

{system_context}

═══════════════════════════════════════════

"""

    backstory += """
    You have access to a knowledge base with detailed system documentation,
    operating procedures, and specifications. When you need information about
    thresholds, limits, or procedures, check your system context above first.
    If the information is not in your context, use the Search Knowledge Base tool.
    Always cite your sources when referencing information from the KB.

    IMPORTANT: When users ask about historical data, time-based questions, or
    specific times/dates, you MUST use the Get Time Series Energy Data tool
    to query the database. NEVER guess or make up times - always check the
    actual data."""

    return Agent(
        role="Energy Systems Monitor",
        goal="Monitor solar, battery, and energy systems and provide clear, accurate status reports",
        backstory=backstory,
        tools=[...],
        verbose=True,
        allow_delegation=False,
    )
```

#### 2. Energy Orchestrator Agent (`energy_orchestrator.py`)

**Similar changes:**
- Imports `get_context_files` from `..tools.kb_search`
- Loads system context when agent is created
- Embeds context in backstory with clear formatting
- Falls back gracefully if no context files are found

### How It Works

1. **When agent is created** (each request):
   - Calls `get_context_files()` which queries database for `is_context_file=TRUE` documents
   - Retrieves full content from `kb_documents` table
   - Formats as markdown sections with clear headers

2. **Context is embedded** in agent backstory:
   - Placed between clear separator lines
   - Marked as "SYSTEM CONTEXT (Always Available)"
   - Agent can reference this without making tool calls

3. **Fallback behavior**:
   - If no context files found, continues without error
   - Agent instructions still tell it to use Search Knowledge Base tool

### Benefits

✅ Agents now "know" system details immediately (hardware, policies, capabilities)
✅ No extra tool calls needed for basic system information
✅ Consistent knowledge across all interactions
✅ Reduced latency for common questions

### Token Impact

- Estimated system context: 2,000-5,000 tokens per request
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet window: 200,000 tokens
- Current typical usage: ~3,000 tokens/query
- After fix: ~5,000-8,000 tokens/query
- **Verdict:** Acceptable overhead

## Fix #2: Pass Context Through Routing

### What Was Changed

**Files Modified:**
- `railway/src/agents/manager.py` (lines 28-101)
- `railway/src/api/main.py` (lines 888-956)

### Changes Made

#### 1. Manager Agent Routing Tools (`manager.py`)

**Before (tools created entire crews):**
```python
@tool("Route to Solar Controller")
def route_to_solar_controller(query: str) -> str:
    crew = create_energy_crew(query)  # ← No context!
    result = crew.kickoff()
    return json.dumps({"response": str(result), ...})
```

**After (tools return routing decisions):**
```python
@tool("Route to Solar Controller")
def route_to_solar_controller(query: str) -> str:
    """Indicate that this query should be routed to the Solar Controller agent."""
    import json
    return json.dumps({
        "action": "route",
        "agent": "Solar Controller",
        "agent_role": "Energy Systems Monitor",
        "query": str(query)
    })
```

**Key change:** Tools no longer execute crews - they just return JSON routing decisions.

#### 2. API Request Handler (`main.py`)

**Before (single crew execution):**
```python
crew = create_manager_crew(request.message, context)
result = crew.kickoff()
result_str = str(result)
```

**After (two-step routing):**
```python
# Step 1: Get routing decision from manager
manager_crew = create_manager_crew(request.message, context)
manager_result = manager_crew.kickoff()
manager_result_str = str(manager_result)

# Step 2: Parse routing decision
routing_decision = json.loads(manager_result_str)  # with error handling

# Step 3: Route to specialist WITH context
if routing_decision and routing_decision.get("action") == "route":
    target_agent = routing_decision.get("agent")

    if target_agent == "Solar Controller":
        specialist_crew = create_energy_crew(
            query=request.message,
            conversation_context=context  # ← Context passed!
        )
        result = specialist_crew.kickoff()
        result_str = str(result)
        agent_used = "Solar Controller"

    elif target_agent == "Energy Orchestrator":
        specialist_crew = create_orchestrator_crew(
            query=request.message,
            context=context  # ← Context passed!
        )
        result = specialist_crew.kickoff()
        result_str = str(result)
        agent_used = "Energy Orchestrator"
else:
    # Manager handled directly (greetings, etc.)
    result_str = manager_result_str
    agent_used = "Manager"
```

### How It Works

**New Flow:**

```
User Query
    ↓
[API loads conversation context from DB]
    ↓
[Manager Crew created with context]
    ↓
[Manager returns routing decision JSON]
    ↓
[API parses decision]
    ↓
[API creates Specialist Crew WITH context]
    ↓
[Specialist has full context]
    ↓
[Response returned to user]
```

**Key improvements:**
1. Manager doesn't execute specialists (just decides routing)
2. API handles actual routing and passes context explicitly
3. Specialists receive both query AND conversation context
4. Clean separation of concerns

### Benefits

✅ Conversation context flows to specialist agents
✅ Multi-turn conversations work properly
✅ Cleaner architecture (Manager is pure router)
✅ Better debugging (can log routing decisions)

### Trade-offs

⚠️ Slight increase in latency (two crew executions: Manager + Specialist)
⚠️ More complex API logic (routing decision parsing)

## Testing Recommendations

### Test 1: System Knowledge
**Query:** "What system are you managing? What hardware do you have?"

**Expected Result:**
- Agent should mention specific hardware (SolArk 15K, 48kWh battery, etc.)
- Agent should NOT say "let me search..." - should know immediately

### Test 2: Context Continuity
**Setup:** Multi-turn conversation in same session

**Turn 1:**
- Query: "What's my battery level?"
- Expected: "Your battery is at X%"

**Turn 2:**
- Query: "Is that good?"
- Expected: Should reference the X% from Turn 1
- Should NOT ask "What are you asking about?"

### Test 3: Policy Knowledge
**Query:** "What's the minimum battery SOC I should maintain?"

**Expected Result:**
- Agent should answer immediately from system context
- Should mention 30% minimum or 40% safe minimum
- Should NOT need to search knowledge base

### Test 4: Capability Boundaries
**Query:** "Can you change my inverter settings?"

**Expected Result:**
- Agent should clearly state it cannot do this
- Should reference system context about limitations

## What's Still Needed

### Short Term
- [ ] Test all diagnostic queries above
- [ ] Monitor token usage in production
- [ ] Check that `get_context_files()` returns valid content
- [ ] Verify KB has documents with `is_context_file=TRUE`

### Medium Term
- [ ] Optimize context loading (only load relevant context per query)
- [ ] Implement context caching to reduce database queries
- [ ] Add telemetry to track context usage
- [ ] Consider using Anthropic's prompt caching for cost reduction

### Long Term
- [ ] Create `ContextManager` service for centralized context handling
- [ ] Implement agent factory pattern for consistent context loading
- [ ] Separate system context into code (not database) for faster access
- [ ] Consider unified crew with hierarchical process (single crew execution)

   git checkout HEAD~1 railway/src/agents/solar_controller.py
   git checkout HEAD~1 railway/src/agents/energy_orchestrator.py
   ```

2. **Revert Fix #2:**
   ```bash

   git checkout HEAD~1 railway/src/api/main.py
   ```

3. **Full rollback:**
   ```bash
   git revert <commit-hash>
   ```

## Performance Monitoring

**Key Metrics to Watch:**

1. **Token Usage**
   - Before: ~3,000 tokens/query
   - Target: ~5,000-8,000 tokens/query
   - Alarm: >10,000 tokens/query

2. **Response Latency**
   - Before: ~2-3 seconds
   - Target: ~3-4 seconds (one extra crew execution)
   - Alarm: >6 seconds

3. **Error Rate**
   - Target: <5% errors
   - Watch for: JSON parsing failures, context loading failures

4. **Context Relevance**
   - Measure: % of responses that correctly reference system context
   - Target: >90%

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Context loaded on every request:**
   - No caching yet
   - Database query every time agent is created
   - *Mitigation:* Will add caching in future iteration

2. **All context loaded (not selective):**
   - Loads all `is_context_file=TRUE` documents
   - Not optimized for query relevance
   - *Mitigation:* Will add smart context loading later

3. **Two crew executions per routed query:**
   - Manager crew + Specialist crew
   - Increases latency slightly
   - *Mitigation:* Could use hierarchical process in future

4. **JSON parsing fragility:**
   - Relies on Manager returning valid JSON
   - Has fallbacks but could be more robust
   - *Mitigation:* Will add structured output in future

---

## Success Criteria

These fixes are considered successful if:

✅ Agents can answer system-specific questions without searching
✅ Multi-turn conversations maintain context properly
✅ Token usage stays under 10,000 per query
✅ Response latency stays under 5 seconds
✅ Error rate stays below 5%

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:**
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Run diagnostic tests
   - Monitor metrics for 24 hours

2. **This Week:**
   - Create test cases for regression testing
   - Document any issues found
   - Adjust based on real-world usage

3. **Next Sprint:**
