Session 005 Summary - October 4, 2025
What We Accomplished
1. Built Solar Controller Agent (COMPLETE)

Created railway/src/tools/solark.py - SolArk API integration
Created railway/src/agents/solar_controller.py - Energy monitoring agent
Updated railway/src/api/main.py to use Solar Controller
DEPLOYED AND WORKING - Agent successfully answers questions about your battery, solar, and power usage in production

2. Database Architecture Decision (COMPLETE)

Decided on PostgreSQL + Extensions approach
Using TimescaleDB (time-series optimization) + pgvector (embeddings)
Chose Docker image timescale/timescaledb-ha:pg16 for full control

3. Database Infrastructure Setup (IN PROGRESS)

Created Railway postgres service (Docker-based TimescaleDB)
Created railway/src/utils/db.py with connection pooling and helper functions
Updated railway/src/api/main.py with production-quality health checks
Added psycopg2-binary to requirements.txt

Current Blocker
DATABASE_URL variable is malformed in Railway.
Current state:
postgresql://postgres:1tVY3mhx1Xt3d7tvBrDKU0ZC0JO7u010bcisH25jNkg@postgres.railway.internal:5432/
Missing the database name at the end. Should be:
postgresql://postgres:1tVY3mhx1Xt3d7tvBrDKU0ZC0JO7u010bcisH25jNkg@postgres.railway.internal:5432/commandcenter
What's Working in Production

Solar Controller agent: LIVE at https://api.wildfireranch.us/ask
SolArk integration: Reading real-time battery, solar, load data
Health endpoint: Returns detailed status at https://api.wildfireranch.us/health
All components report healthy EXCEPT database_connected

Next Steps

Fix DATABASE_URL in Railway (add database name)
Verify database connection works
Initialize database schema (enable extensions, create tables)
Wire Solar Controller to store queries/responses in database
Add historical data queries ("show me last 24 hours")
