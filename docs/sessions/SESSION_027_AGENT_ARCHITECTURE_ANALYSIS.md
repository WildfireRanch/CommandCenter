# Session 027: Agent Architecture Analysis - General vs. Specialized

**Date:** October 11, 2025
**Type:** Architecture Review, Problem Diagnosis, Strategic Planning
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

---

## üéØ Session Objectives

1. Diagnose why agent routing fails for meta/system queries
2. Analyze KB search returning irrelevant results (Cisco switches, Victron manuals)
3. Evaluate if current 3-agent architecture is over-specialized
4. Determine if a general-purpose agent is needed
5. Provide strategic recommendations for architecture improvements

---

## üîç Problem Investigation

### **Issue #1: Agent Routing Confusion**

**User Report:** "my agent /agent is totally confused when I ask 'what is the command center?'"

**Observed Behavior:**
```
Query: "what is the command center?"
‚Üì
Routed to: Solar Controller (wrong!)
‚Üì
Response: KB search results with:
- context-commandcenter (similarity: 0.44)
- Cisco_350_Switch.pdf (similarity: 0.31) ‚ùå
- Victron_CerboGX_Manual.pdf (similarity: 0.29) ‚ùå
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Should recognize as system/meta query
- Should return CommandCenter system overview
- Should NOT route to Solar Controller

---

### **Root Cause Analysis**

#### **Cause #1: KB Fast-Path Keywords Too Narrow**
**File:** [railway/src/api/main.py:875-879](../../railway/src/api/main.py#L875)

```python
kb_keywords = ['specification', 'specs', 'threshold', 'policy', 'policies',
              'procedure', 'maintain', 'maintenance', 'documentation', 'guide',
              'manual', 'instructions', 'how do i', 'how to']
# Avoid: "what is" (too broad - catches "what is my battery level")
```

**Problem:** "what is" explicitly excluded to prevent false positives
**Impact:** System queries like "what is command center" bypass KB fast-path
**Result:** Query routes to Manager ‚Üí Solar Controller (default fallback)

---

#### **Cause #2: KB Contains Irrelevant Technical Documents**

**KB Stats:** 14 documents, 325 chunks, 4 context files

**Document Quality Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ `context-commandcenter` - Relevant but low similarity (0.44)
- ‚ùå `Cisco_350_Switch.pdf` - Network equipment manual (irrelevant!)
- ‚ùå `Victron_CerboGX_Manual.pdf` - Battery controller manual (too generic)

**Problems:**
1. **Generic equipment manuals** pollute search results
2. **CommandCenter overview** not optimized for "what is" queries
3. **Low semantic similarity** - long document with too much detail
4. **Context files not loaded** into Solar Controller agent prompt

---

#### **Cause #3: Manager Agent Over-Routes**

**File:** [railway/src/agents/manager.py:195-234](../../railway/src/agents/manager.py#L195)

**Current Behavior:**
```python
backstory="""You are a ROUTING-ONLY agent. Your ONLY job is to call the right
tool and return its output EXACTLY as received...

Off-topic/greetings ‚Üí Respond briefly (only case where you don't use a tool)
Examples: hello, who am I, unrelated topics
```

**Problem:** Manager tries to route EVERYTHING to tools, including:
- System/meta queries ("what is command center")
- Ambiguous queries ("help me", "what do you think")
- Off-topic queries ("who am I", "tell me a joke")

**Impact:**
- Session 023: "who am I" caused infinite retry loop
- Recent: 4x "what is command center" queries routed incorrectly

---

## üìä Architecture Assessment

### **Current 3-Agent System**

```
User Query
    ‚Üì
KB Fast-Path Check (keyword matching, ~400ms)
    ‚Üì (if no match)
Manager Agent (query router, ~1-2s)
    ‚Üì
‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Solar Controller (real-time status, ~5-6s)
‚îÇ   Tools: get_energy_status, get_historical_stats,
‚îÇ          get_time_series_data, search_knowledge_base
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Energy Orchestrator (planning/optimization, ~13-15s)
‚îÇ   Tools: optimize_battery, coordinate_miners,
‚îÇ          create_energy_plan, get_current_status
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí KB Search Direct (documentation, ~400ms)
    Tools: search_knowledge_base (pgvector similarity)
```

### **Query Distribution Analysis**

**From Last 10 Conversations:**
- **80%** - Energy status queries ‚Üí Solar Controller ‚úÖ
  - "battery level", "solar production", "hour by hour data"
- **15%** - Meta/system queries ‚Üí Incorrectly routed ‚ùå
  - "what is command center" (4x), "what do you think"
- **5%** - Off-topic queries ‚Üí Hung/failed ‚ùå
  - "who am I" (Session 023 hang)

### **Strengths of Current Architecture**

‚úÖ **Highly Optimized Performance**
- KB fast-path: 400ms (50x faster than Manager routing)
- Specialized agents have focused tool sets
- Clear separation of concerns (monitoring vs planning vs docs)

‚úÖ **Excellent for Primary Use Cases**
- Real-time energy monitoring: 5-6s response time
- Historical analysis: Accurate time-series queries
- Planning decisions: Context-aware recommendations

‚úÖ **Cost Efficient**
- Each agent only loads relevant tools (smaller prompts)
- KB fast-path bypasses LLM for documentation queries
- Focused context = fewer tokens per query

‚úÖ **Maintainable**
- Clear agent responsibilities
- Easy to debug routing issues
- Simple to add new specialized agents

### **Weaknesses Identified**

‚ùå **No Fallback for Edge Cases**
- System/meta queries route incorrectly
- Off-topic queries cause hangs or wrong responses
- Ambiguous queries confuse the router

‚ùå **KB Fast-Path Too Narrow**
- Misses "what is" queries to avoid false positives
- Requires exact keyword matches
- Brittle pattern matching

‚ùå **Manager Over-Thinks**
- Tries to route everything to tools
- Should answer some queries directly
- No explicit fallback handling

---

## ü§î Strategic Question: Do We Need a General Agent?

### **Definition**
**General Agent:** Single agent with broad capabilities to handle any query type without specialization.

### **Analysis: Would General Agent Help?**

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Could handle meta/system queries naturally
- ‚úÖ Single point of entry (simpler routing)
- ‚úÖ More flexible for diverse query types

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå **Slower responses** - Needs broader context, more tools loaded
- ‚ùå **Higher costs** - Larger prompts = more tokens per query
- ‚ùå **Less accurate** - Jack of all trades, master of none
- ‚ùå **Harder to maintain** - Single agent doing everything
- ‚ùå **Loss of optimization** - KB fast-path wouldn't apply
- ‚ùå **Diluted expertise** - Solar Controller already excellent

**Comparison Table:**

| Aspect | Current (Specialized) | General Agent |
|--------|----------------------|---------------|
| Energy query accuracy | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| Response time | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (KB: 400ms) | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (slower) |
| Meta query handling | ‚≠ê‚≠ê (poor) | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (good) |
| Cost per query | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (optimized) | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (higher) |
| Maintainability | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (clear) | ‚≠ê‚≠ê (complex) |
| Edge case handling | ‚≠ê‚≠ê (poor) | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (better) |

### **Verdict: NO - General Agent Not Recommended**

**Your specialization is a STRENGTH, not a weakness!**

The current architecture handles 80%+ of queries perfectly with:
- Excellent accuracy for energy queries
- Fast response times
- Low operational costs
- Clear maintenance boundaries

**The real issue:** Edge case handling (15-20% of queries)

**Solution:** Fix the edge cases, don't rebuild the architecture!

## ‚úÖ Recommended Solutions

### **Phase 1: Quick Wins (15 minutes)**

#### **Fix #1: Expand KB Fast-Path Keywords**
**File:** `railway/src/api/main.py:875`

```python
# BEFORE
kb_keywords = ['specification', 'specs', 'threshold', 'policy', 'policies',
              'procedure', 'maintain', 'maintenance', 'documentation', 'guide',
              'manual', 'instructions', 'how do i', 'how to']
# Avoid: "what is" (too broad)

# AFTER
kb_keywords = ['specification', 'specs', 'threshold', 'policy', 'policies',
              'procedure', 'maintain', 'maintenance', 'documentation', 'guide',
              'manual', 'instructions', 'how do i', 'how to',
              'what is the command', 'what is command center',  # Specific to avoid battery queries
              'how does command', 'system overview']
```

**Impact:** Routes system queries directly to KB (400ms response)

---

#### **Fix #2: Improve Manager Fallback Handling**
**File:** `railway/src/agents/manager.py:195-234`

```python
# UPDATE backstory (line 195)
backstory="""You are a ROUTING-ONLY agent with INTELLIGENT FALLBACK.

CRITICAL ROUTING RULES:

1. SYSTEM/META QUERIES ‚Üí Respond directly with system info (NO TOOL)
   Patterns: "what is command center", "how does this work", "who made this"
   Response: Brief explanation of CommandCenter system

2. OFF-TOPIC QUERIES ‚Üí Polite redirect (NO TOOL)
   Patterns: "who am I", "tell me a joke", "what's the weather"
   Response: "I'm an energy management assistant. I can help you with battery
             status, solar production, energy planning, and system documentation."

3. AMBIGUOUS QUERIES ‚Üí Ask for clarification (NO TOOL)
   Patterns: "help", "what do you think", unclear intent
   Response: Ask what specific information they need (battery? planning? docs?)

4. ENERGY QUERIES ‚Üí Route to appropriate tool
   Real-time ‚Üí route_to_solar_controller(query)
   Planning ‚Üí route_to_energy_orchestrator(query)
   Documentation ‚Üí search_kb_directly(query)

CRITICAL: Categories 1-3 NEVER call tools. Respond directly and briefly.
Only category 4 (energy queries) should call routing tools."""
```

**Impact:** Manager answers meta/off-topic queries in ~1s instead of routing incorrectly

---

### **Phase 2: KB Quality Improvements (30 minutes)**

#### **Fix #3: Clean KB Pollution**

**Via Railway PostgreSQL Console:**
```sql
-- Remove irrelevant technical manuals
DELETE FROM kb_documents
WHERE title IN ('Cisco_350_Switch.pdf', 'Victron_CerboGX_Manual.pdf');

-- Mark CommandCenter docs as high-priority context
UPDATE kb_documents
SET is_context_file = TRUE
WHERE title LIKE '%CommandCenter%'
   OR title LIKE '%context-commandcenter%'
   OR folder LIKE '%CONTEXT%';
```

**Impact:** Cleaner search results, better semantic similarity

---

#### **Fix #4: Create Optimized System Overview**

**Create:** `docs/kb/CommandCenter-Overview.md` (400 words)

```markdown

---

### **Phase 3: Validation (5 minutes)**

#### **Test Cases**

```bash
# Test 1: System query (should use KB fast-path)
curl -X POST https://api.wildfireranch.us/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "what is the command center?"}'
# Expected: CommandCenter overview from KB, ~400ms

# Test 2: Off-topic query (should get polite redirect)
curl -X POST https://api.wildfireranch.us/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "who am I?"}'
# Expected: "I'm an energy management assistant...", ~1-2s

# Test 3: Energy query (should route to Solar Controller)
curl -X POST https://api.wildfireranch.us/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "whats my battery level?"}'
# Expected: Current battery status, ~5-6s

# Test 4: Planning query (should route to Energy Orchestrator)
curl -X POST https://api.wildfireranch.us/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "should we run miners tonight?"}'
# Expected: Planning recommendation, ~13-15s
```

- User satisfaction with meta query responses

---

## üìù Key Learnings

### **Architecture Principles Validated**

1. **Specialization is Good** - Focused agents are more accurate than general agents
2. **Fast-paths Matter** - 400ms KB responses 50x faster than Manager routing
3. **Edge Cases are Normal** - 15-20% edge cases don't invalidate 80%+ success
4. **Fix the Gap, Don't Rebuild** - Better fallback > architectural overhaul

### **What NOT to Do**

‚ùå **Don't add a general agent** - Dilutes expertise, increases cost, slows responses
‚ùå **Don't over-engineer routing** - Simple keyword matching works for common cases
‚ùå **Don't keep irrelevant KB docs** - Pollutes search, reduces accuracy
‚ùå **Don't route everything to tools** - Some queries need direct answers

### **What DOES Work**

‚úÖ **Specialized agents with clear domains** - Solar Controller excels at energy queries
‚úÖ **Multi-tier routing** - Fast-path (keywords) ‚Üí Manager (LLM) ‚Üí Specialists
‚úÖ **Focused tool sets** - Each agent only loads relevant tools
‚úÖ **Conversation context** - Agents reference previous interactions
