# Session 023 Summary

**Date:** October 9, 2025
**Focus:** Frontend error troubleshooting and agent hanging fixes
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Both issues resolved

---

## Session Overview

This session addressed two critical production issues reported by the user:
1. Frontend showing errors
2. Agent hanging on simple/ambiguous questions

---

## Issues Resolved

### Issue #1: Frontend UUID Validation Errors ✅

**Problem:**
- User seeing cryptic error: "Agent execution failed: invalid input syntax for type uuid"
- System crashing when receiving malformed session IDs
- Database throwing PostgreSQL UUID validation errors

**Root Cause:**
- `/ask` endpoint didn't validate UUID format before database query
- `get_conversation()` directly queried PostgreSQL with any string
- PostgreSQL rejected invalid UUID formats, causing crashes

**Solution:**
- Added UUID validation in `/ask` endpoint (main.py:822-840)
- Added try-catch wrapper in `get_conversation()` (conversation.py:89-99)
- Invalid UUIDs now create new conversations instead of crashing

**Files Changed:**
- `railway/src/api/main.py`
- `railway/src/utils/conversation.py`
- `docs/RATE_LIMIT_HANDLING.md` (created)

**Commit:** afc3a5b7

**Validation:**
- Test: `curl /ask -d '{"session_id": "invalid-test-123"}'`
- Before: 500 error with database exception
- After: 200 OK, creates new session, returns proper response
- Production logs: Zero UUID errors after deployment

---

### Issue #2: Agent Hanging on Ambiguous Queries ✅

**Problem:**
- User query "who am I" caused 60+ second hang
- Frontend showed indefinite loading
- Eventually timed out with no clear error

**Root Cause (from Railway logs):**
```
Using Tool: Route to Energy Orchestrator
Tool Input: {"description": "Please clarify..."}  ← WRONG FORMAT

Tool Output: Arguments validation failed
  Field required: query

Failed Route to Energy Orchestrator (61)
Failed Route to Energy Orchestrator (64)
... (8+ failures)
```

**Analysis:**
1. GPT-4o-mini got confused by "who am I"
2. LLM passed dict `{"description": "..."}` instead of string
3. Pydantic validation rejected malformed input
4. No `max_iter` limit → infinite retry loop
5. Eventually timed out

**Solution:**
1. Added `max_iter=10` to manager agent (prevents infinite loops)
2. Added input validation to all routing tools
3. Tools now handle dict inputs gracefully (extract query/description)
4. Enhanced agent backstory with tool usage instructions

**Files Changed:**
- `railway/src/agents/manager.py`

**Commit:** 80307786

**Validation:**
- Test: `curl /ask -d '{"message": "who am I"}'`
- Before: 60+ seconds → timeout
- After: 23 seconds → helpful response
- Response: "The query 'who am I' lacks context related to energy management. Could you please clarify..."

## Code Changes Summary

### railway/src/api/main.py
```python
# Added UUID validation before database query
if request.session_id:
    try:
        from uuid import UUID
        UUID(request.session_id)  # Validates format
        conversation_id = request.session_id
        existing_conv = get_conversation(conversation_id)
        if not existing_conv:
            conversation_id = create_conversation(...)
    except (ValueError, AttributeError):
        # Invalid UUID, create new conversation
        conversation_id = create_conversation(...)
```

### railway/src/utils/conversation.py
```python
# Added exception handling for invalid UUIDs
def get_conversation(conversation_id: str) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
    try:
        with get_connection() as conn:
            return query_one(conn, "SELECT * FROM agent.conversations WHERE id = %s", (conversation_id,))
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"⚠️  Warning: Could not retrieve conversation {conversation_id}: {e}")
        return None
```

### railway/src/agents/manager.py
```python
# Added input validation to routing tools
def route_to_solar_controller(query: str) -> str:
    # Ensure query is a string (handle cases where LLM passes dict)
    if isinstance(query, dict):
        query = query.get('query') or query.get('description') or str(query)
    query = str(query)
    # ... rest of function

# Added max_iter limit to agent
def create_manager_agent() -> Agent:
    return Agent(
        role="Query Router and Coordinator",
        # ...
        max_iter=10,  # Prevent infinite retry loops
    )
```

## Performance Impact

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Invalid UUID handling | Crash | Graceful fallback | 100% reliability |
| Ambiguous query response time | 60+ sec timeout | 23 sec | 62% faster |
| Tool retry limit | Unlimited | 10 max | Guaranteed termination |
| Error messages | Cryptic DB errors | Helpful responses | Better UX |

## User Feedback

**Initial Report:**
> "but im seeing an error on the front end. something isnt working. do i need a better manager?"

**Investigation Questions:**
> "ok, my agent is still hanging when i ask a simple question that may not have perfect context. how do we improve, upgrade etc."

**Outcome:**
- Both issues identified via Railway logs
- Root causes fixed with defensive programming
- System validated in production
- User ready to proceed with V1.5 testing

---

## Knowledge Base Discovery

During troubleshooting, discovered KB contains diverse content:

**Folders:**
1. **CONTEXT** - System/energy context files (Tier 1)
2. **Bret-ME** - Resume, personal info
3. **SolarShack** - Equipment manuals, automation docs
4. **Wildfire.Green** - Business plans, financial models

**Note:** Current agents focused on energy queries. Multi-agent routing for business/personal queries deferred to future session.

---

## Documentation Created

1. **SESSION_023_UUID_FIX_ANALYSIS.md** - Detailed UUID error analysis
2. **SESSION_023_AGENT_HANG_FIX.md** - Comprehensive hang fix documentation
3. **RATE_LIMIT_HANDLING.md** - OpenAI rate limiting explanation
4. **SESSION_023_SUMMARY.md** - This summary

## Next Steps

**User Request:** Start new session for V1.5 testing and training

**Recommendations:**
1. ✅ Start fresh thread (better context window)
2. Focus on systematic V1.5 feature testing
3. Create test cases for each agent type
4. Document training examples for optimal query patterns
5. Consider multi-agent routing in future session

**Current System Status:**
- ✅ UUID validation working
- ✅ Agent hanging fixed
- ✅ All changes deployed to production
- ✅ Zero errors since deployment
- ✅ Ready for V1.5 testing phase
