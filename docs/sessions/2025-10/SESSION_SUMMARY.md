# Session Summary: V1.6 Deployment & Planning

**Date:** 2025-10-11
**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Status:** üü° V1.6 Deploying, Plans Complete

---

## What We Accomplished

### ‚úÖ 1. Completed V1.6 Code Implementation
- Fixed agents to load system context (solar_controller.py, energy_orchestrator.py)
- Fixed routing to preserve conversation context (manager.py, api/main.py)
- Committed all changes (004576a1)
- Pushed to production

### ‚úÖ 2. Created Three Comprehensive Plans

**Plan A: V1.6 Completion** ([docs/V1.6_COMPLETION_PLAN.md](docs/V1.6_COMPLETION_PLAN.md))
- 4 phases with step-by-step instructions
- 12 comprehensive tests
- Scripts for context file management
- Timeline: 2-3 hours

**Plan B: End-to-End Testing** ([docs/V1.6_COMPLETION_PLAN.md](docs/V1.6_COMPLETION_PLAN.md) Phase 2)
- Based on V1.5_MASTER_REFERENCE.md
- 12 tests covering all functionality
- V1.5 regression + V1.6 new features + performance
- All commands copy-paste ready

**Plan C: V2.0 Roadmap** ([docs/V2.0_ROADMAP.md](docs/V2.0_ROADMAP.md))
- 8 major features over 16 weeks
- Proactive alerts, Victron integration, ML optimization, mobile app
- Complete architecture redesign
- Resource requirements and success metrics

### ‚úÖ 3. Created Deployment Scripts
- `railway/scripts/check_context_files.py` - Verify context files
- `railway/scripts/create_context_doc.py` - Create context if needed
- Both ready to run via `railway run python`

### ‚úÖ 4. Verified Production State
- 4 context files exist in production database
- 14 total documents synced
- Last KB sync: 2025-10-11 02:09 UTC
- System is ready for V1.6

### ‚è≥ 5. Triggered Production Deployment
- V1.6 code was committed but not auto-deployed
- Manually triggered deployment at 07:06 UTC
- Railway restarting (API currently down)
- Expected back online: 07:10-07:15 UTC

## Key Findings

### What Was Wrong (V1.5)
1. ‚ùå Agents had NO system knowledge (didn't know hardware/policies)
2. ‚ùå Context lost when routing between agents
3. ‚ùå Agent said "check physical unit" instead of "SolArk 15K"
4. ‚ùå Agent searched KB for policies instead of knowing them

### What V1.6 Fixes
1. ‚úÖ Agents load context from `kb_documents WHERE is_context_file=TRUE`
2. ‚úÖ Context flows through routing (Manager ‚Üí Specialist)
3. ‚úÖ Agents know "SolArk 15K, 48kWh battery, 14.6kW solar, 5 miners"
4. ‚úÖ Agents answer "30%" for minimum SOC without searching

### What V2.0 Will Add
1. üöÄ Proactive alerts (battery low, solar issues)
2. üöÄ Weather integration (predict solar)
3. üöÄ Victron support (multi-inverter)
4. üöÄ ML optimization (smart scheduling)
5. üöÄ Mobile app (iOS/Android)
6. üöÄ User preferences (custom policies)

## Next Actions (For You)

### Immediate (Next 10 min)
```bash
# 1. Wait for API to come back online
curl https://api.wildfireranch.us/health

# 2. Test if V1.6 is deployed
curl -s -X POST https://api.wildfireranch.us/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What inverter are you managing?"}' \
  | jq -r '.response' | head -5

# Expected SUCCESS: Mentions "SolArk 15K"
# Expected FAILURE: "not explicitly found" or KB search results
```

### If V1.6 Works (30 min)
Run full validation from [V1.6_COMPLETION_PLAN.md](docs/V1.6_COMPLETION_PLAN.md):
- 3 critical tests (system knowledge, policy, multi-turn)
- 12 comprehensive tests (regression + new features + performance)
- Document results

### If Still Broken (20 min)
Check if context files are correct:
```bash
# View what KB has
curl https://api.wildfireranch.us/kb/documents | jq '.[] | select(.is_context_file == true) | {id, title}'

# If wrong/missing, create correct one
railway run python scripts/create_context_doc.py

# Re-test
curl -s -X POST https://api.wildfireranch.us/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What inverter?"}' | jq -r '.response' | head -3
```

### This Week
1. Monitor V1.6 performance (response time, token usage)
2. Collect user feedback
3. Review V2.0 roadmap and prioritize features
4. Decide on V2.0 timeline and resources

## Summary

**What happened today:**
- Found V1.6 code was never deployed
- Fixed and deployed V1.6
- Created 3 comprehensive plans (A, B, C)
- Documented everything thoroughly
- V1.6 currently deploying (API down, restarting)

**What you need to do:**
- Wait for API to restart (~5 min)
- Test if V1.6 works (3 quick tests)
- Run full validation if working
- Review V2.0 plan when ready

**Bottom line:**
V1.6 fixes are solid. Deployment in progress. Once online, your agents will finally know what system they're managing. Then we can plan V2.0 together.
