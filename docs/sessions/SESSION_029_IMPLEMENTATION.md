## 💰 Cost Analysis

### Tavily API Pricing

**Free Tier**: 1,000 searches/month (no credit card required)
- Sufficient for initial deployment
- Typical usage: 10-20 queries/day = 300-600/month

**Paid Tiers** (if needed later):
- Basic: $20/month for 10,000 searches
- Pro: $100/month for 100,000 searches

### Estimated Monthly Costs

**Scenario 1: Low Usage (10 queries/day)**
- Monthly queries: ~300
- Cost: **FREE** (within free tier)

**Scenario 2: Medium Usage (20 queries/day)**
- Monthly queries: ~600
- Cost: **FREE** (within free tier)

**Scenario 3: High Usage (50 queries/day)**
- Monthly queries: ~1,500
- Cost: **$20/month** (Basic tier)

**Recommendation**: Start with free tier, monitor usage via Tavily dashboard

## 🔍 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Use Tavily MCP Instead of Direct API

**Why**:
- Better separation of concerns
- MCP protocol allows swapping providers without code changes
- Same MCP server used by Claude Desktop (reusable)
- Easier testing and monitoring

**Trade-off**: Extra network hop, but worth it for architecture

### 2. Research Agent Gets FULL 24KB Context

**Why**:
- Needs comprehensive understanding for comparisons
- Can answer "How does MY system compare to..." questions
- Provides context-aware recommendations

**Trade-off**: Higher token costs, but necessary for quality

### 3. Remote MCP Server Instead of Local

**Why**:
- Zero infrastructure (hosted by Tavily)
- Production-ready out of the box
- No need to manage MCP server process

**Trade-off**: Depends on Tavily uptime (99.9% SLA)

### 4. 30s Timeout for Web Search

**Why**:
- Web searches typically take 5-15s
- Extra buffer for slow networks
- Better than default 120s timeout

**Trade-off**: Longer wait for users, but acceptable for research queries

---

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **No Local Testing of Web Search**
   - Requires TAVILY_API_KEY (not set locally)
   - Web search testing requires production deployment
   - Mitigation: Validated structure, routing, and agent creation

2. **Response Time (20-30s)**
   - Longer than specialist agents (5-13s)
   - Expected due to web search latency
   - Acceptable for research queries (non-urgent)

3. **Free Tier Limit (1,000 searches/month)**
   - Need to monitor usage via Tavily dashboard
   - Implement caching if usage exceeds limit
   - Consider upgrading to paid tier if needed

### Future Enhancements (V1.8+)

1. **Response Caching**
   - Cache common research queries
   - Reduce duplicate web searches
   - Lower Tavily API usage

2. **Additional MCP Tools**
   - `tavily-map` - Map website structure
   - `tavily-crawl` - Deep research on topics
   - PDF analysis for technical papers

3. **Query Optimization**
   - Pre-filter queries to avoid unnecessary web searches
   - Combine multiple search results intelligently
   - Better source citation formatting
