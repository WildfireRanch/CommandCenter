# Session 032: Database Health Monitoring Migration Completion

**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete
**Type**: Infrastructure Fix & Deployment

---

## üéØ Objective

Complete the Database Health Dashboard setup by executing the `004_health_monitoring.sql` migration that creates the `monitoring.health_snapshots` table for historical health data collection.

---

## üìã Context

Session 031 completed all code implementation for the Database Health Dashboard, but the final migration needed to be run to create the database table. The backend was deployed and working, but the history endpoint was failing with "relation does not exist" error.

**Initial State**:
- ‚úÖ All code implemented and deployed
- ‚úÖ Health status endpoint working
- ‚úÖ Frontend dashboard deployed
- ‚ùå History endpoint failing - table doesn't exist
- ‚ùå Health monitor not collecting snapshots

---

## üîç Investigation & Root Cause

### Initial Problem
Called `/db/init-schema` endpoint multiple times, but table was never created despite "success" response.

### Discovery Process

1. **First Attempt**: Direct database connection from Codespaces
   - ‚ùå Failed: `postgres_db.railway.internal` not resolvable outside Railway network
   - Learned: Railway internal hostnames only work within Railway infrastructure

2. **Second Attempt**: Using Railway CLI commands
   - Installed PostgreSQL client in Codespaces
   - ‚ùå Still failed: Can't connect to internal hostname

3. **Third Attempt**: Checking init-schema endpoint behavior
   - Created diagnostic endpoint `/db/run-health-migration`
   - **Root Cause Identified**: psql not installed in Railway Docker container

4. **Diagnostic Results**:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "partial",
     "method": "psycopg2",
     "executed": [],
     "errors": [
       "Statement 1: syntax error at or near \"EXCEPTION\"",
       "Statement 2: unterminated dollar-quoted string at or near \"$$;\"",
       ...
     ]
   }
   ```

### Root Cause Analysis

**Problem**: Python's `psycopg2.cursor.execute()` cannot execute multiple SQL statements in one call.

**Why Migration Failed**:
1. `init_schema()` function tried to execute entire SQL file with single `cursor.execute()`
2. This only works for single-statement SQL
3. Migration file `004_health_monitoring.sql` contains:
   - Multiple CREATE statements
   - PL/pgSQL `DO $$...$$;` blocks (dollar-quoted strings)
   - TimescaleDB function calls
4. Simple splitting on `;` breaks DO blocks and causes syntax errors
5. Without psql, the fallback to naive semicolon-splitting failed

**Secondary Issue**: Even after fixing migration, service didn't pick up the table because:
- Health Monitor checks schema at startup
- If check fails, sets `is_running = False` and stops
- Creating table after startup doesn't trigger restart

---

## üîß Solution

### 1. Install PostgreSQL Client in Docker

**File**: `railway/Dockerfile`

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app

# Install PostgreSQL client for running migrations
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends postgresql-client && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Update init_schema() to Use psql Subprocess

**File**: `railway/src/utils/db.py`

```python
# Use subprocess to run psql for complex SQL files
import subprocess
import tempfile

try:
    # Write SQL to temp file
    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w', suffix='.sql', delete=False) as f:
        f.write(schema_sql)
        temp_file = f.name

    # Get DATABASE_URL
    db_url = os.getenv('DATABASE_URL')

    # Run psql
    result = subprocess.run(
        ['psql', db_url, '-f', temp_file],
        capture_output=True,
        text=True,
        timeout=30
    )

    os.unlink(temp_file)

    if result.returncode == 0:
        print(f"‚úÖ Migration completed: {migration_file_name}")
    else:
        print(f"‚ùå Migration failed: {result.stderr}")

except FileNotFoundError:
    # Fall back to psycopg2 for local dev
    pass
```

### 3. Create Diagnostic Endpoint

**File**: `railway/src/api/main.py`

Added `/db/run-health-migration` endpoint that:
- Attempts psql execution first
- Falls back to psycopg2 with detailed error tracking
- Returns comprehensive status including stdout/stderr
- Helps diagnose migration issues

### 4. Service Restart

After migration succeeded, redeployed service to restart Health Monitor:
```bash
railway redeploy --service CommandCenter -y
```

---

## üìä Results

### Migration Success
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Migration completed via psql",
  "method": "psql",
  "stdout": "CREATE SCHEMA\nCREATE TABLE\nDO\nCREATE INDEX...",
  "timestamp": 1760574722.9476433
}
```

### History Endpoint Working
```bash
$ curl https://api.wildfireranch.us/health/monitoring/history?hours=1
{
  "status": "success",
  "hours": 1,
  "data": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2025-10-16T00:44:33.344107+00:00",
      "overall_status": "degraded",
      "solark_collection_health_pct": 28.54,
      "victron_collection_health_pct": 28.54,
      "db_response_time_ms": 3.95,
      "solark_records_24h": 137,
      "victron_records_24h": 137,
      "critical_alerts": 0,
      "warning_alerts": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

### Health Monitor Active
- Collecting snapshots every 5 minutes
- Storing data in `monitoring.health_snapshots` table
- Historical data available for dashboard charts
- 14-day retention policy active

## üéì Lessons Learned

### 1. Railway Network Isolation
- `.railway.internal` hostnames **only work inside Railway**
- Cannot connect from Codespaces, local machines, or CI/CD
- Must use API endpoints or Railway CLI with `railway run`

### 2. Multi-Statement SQL Execution
- `psycopg2.cursor.execute()` is single-statement only (security feature)
- Complex migrations with DO blocks require psql
- Naive semicolon splitting breaks dollar-quoted strings
- Always use `psql -f` for migration files

### 3. Docker Container Requirements
- Migrations running inside containers need psql installed
- Don't assume standard tools are available
- Test migrations in actual deployment environment
- Add diagnostic endpoints for production troubleshooting

### 4. Service Lifecycle Management
- Services that check schema at startup won't auto-restart
- Schema changes require service redeploy
- Consider using health checks that trigger restarts
- Document restart requirements in migration guides

### 5. Debugging in Production
- Create diagnostic endpoints with detailed error reporting
- Return stdout/stderr from subprocess calls
- Include "method used" in responses (psql vs psycopg2)
- Log execution paths for troubleshooting
