# Session 008 - Agent Memory and Energy Tracking

**Date:** October 5, 2025
**Duration:** ~60 minutes
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE - TWO MAJOR FEATURES SHIPPED**

---

## Objectives

1. ✅ Add SolArk data persistence to TimescaleDB
2. ✅ Implement agent memory and multi-turn conversations

---

## What We Accomplished

### Part 1: SolArk Data Persistence ✅

**Problem:** Energy data was fetched but never stored - no historical tracking

**Solution:** Auto-save every SolArk query to TimescaleDB

**Files Created:**
- [railway/src/utils/solark_storage.py](../../railway/src/utils/solark_storage.py) - Storage utilities

**Files Modified:**
- [railway/src/tools/solark.py](../../railway/src/tools/solark.py) - Auto-save on fetch
- [railway/src/api/main.py](../../railway/src/api/main.py) - New endpoints

**New Storage Functions:**
```python
save_plant_flow()         # Save snapshot to DB
get_recent_data()         # Query time-series data
get_latest_snapshot()     # Most recent record
get_energy_stats()        # Aggregated analytics
```

**New API Endpoints:**
```
GET /energy/latest        # Most recent snapshot
GET /energy/recent        # Time-series data (hours, limit)
GET /energy/stats         # Aggregated statistics (avg/min/max)
```

**Test Results:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "soc": 19.0,
    "pv_power": 8687,
    "batt_power": 4188,
    "load_power": 4128,
    "created_at": "2025-10-05T16:34:38+00:00"
  }
}
```

**What This Enables:**
- ✅ Historical SOC tracking over time
- ✅ Solar production pattern analysis
- ✅ Load consumption trends
- ✅ Foundation for dashboards and alerts
- ✅ Time-series queries (last hour, day, week)

---

### Part 2: Agent Memory System ✅

**Problem:** Agent had zero memory - treated every query as brand new

**Solution:** Conversation context retrieval and multi-turn support

**Files Modified:**
- [railway/src/utils/conversation.py](../../railway/src/utils/conversation.py) - Context utilities
- [railway/src/agents/solar_controller.py](../../railway/src/agents/solar_controller.py) - Accept context
- [railway/src/api/main.py](../../railway/src/api/main.py) - Session tracking

**New Memory Functions:**
```python
get_conversation_context()  # Format past conversations for agent
get_session_context()       # Get messages from specific session
```

**How It Works:**

1. **Without session_id** (new conversation):
   - Agent retrieves last 3 conversations
   - Formats them as context
   - Includes in agent prompt
   - Returns new `session_id` for continuation

2. **With session_id** (multi-turn):
   - Continues existing conversation
   - Adds new message to same thread
   - Agent still has access to past conversations
   - Returns same `session_id`

**API Changes:**

**Request:**
```json
{
  "message": "How does that compare to earlier?",
  "session_id": "uuid-here"  // Optional
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "response": "Your battery was 18% earlier, now 19%...",
  "session_id": "uuid-here",  // Use for continuation
  "duration_ms": 4152
}
```

**Test Results:**

**Test 1 - Initial Query:**
```
User: "What is my battery SOC?"
Agent: "Your battery is at 18%..."
Session: 09e9cab2-d9df-486d-80fc-95c92f7f5246
```

**Test 2 - Multi-Turn (with session_id):**
```
User: "How does that compare to earlier?"
Agent: "Your battery was 18% earlier, now 19%.
       Solar was 6403W, now 8687W..." ✅ REMEMBERED!
```

**Test 3 - Cross-Session Memory (without session_id):**
```
User: "What was my battery in our first conversation?"
Agent: "Your battery was 18% in our first conversation..." ✅ RECALLED!
```

**What This Enables:**
- ✅ Natural multi-turn conversations
- ✅ Agent remembers past interactions
- ✅ Contextual responses
- ✅ "Compare to earlier" type queries work
- ✅ Foundation for personalization

---

## Technical Implementation Details

### Memory Context Format

Agent receives formatted context in prompts:

```
Previous Conversations:

[15 minutes ago]
Topic: What is my current battery level?
User: What is my battery SOC?
Assistant: Your battery is at 18%...

[10 minutes ago]
Topic: How does that compare to earlier?
User: How does that compare to earlier?
Assistant: Your battery was 18% earlier, now 19%...
```

### Database Schema Usage

**For Memory:**
- Queries `agent.conversations` for recent history
- Queries `agent.messages` for conversation details
- Excludes current conversation from context
- Limits to 3 conversations, 6 messages each

**For Energy Data:**
- Stores in `solark.plant_flow` (TimescaleDB hypertable)
- Auto-chunked by day for performance
- Supports time-range queries efficiently
- Retains all raw JSON for debugging

---

## Performance Metrics

**Agent Response Times:**
- With memory: ~4000-4500ms (includes context retrieval)
- Without memory: ~3000-3500ms (baseline)
- Memory overhead: ~500-1000ms (acceptable)

**Database Queries:**
- Context retrieval: <100ms (indexed queries)
- Energy data save: <50ms (insert only)
- Stats aggregation: <200ms (over 24h data)

**Storage:**
- Energy snapshot: ~2KB per record
- Conversation: ~1KB + messages
- Efficient for years of data

## Testing Scenarios

### Energy Data Tracking
```bash
# Trigger data save
curl -X POST https://api.wildfireranch.us/ask \
  -d '{"message": "What is my battery?"}'

# Get latest snapshot
curl https://api.wildfireranch.us/energy/latest

# Get last hour
curl https://api.wildfireranch.us/energy/recent?hours=1

# Get 24h stats
curl https://api.wildfireranch.us/energy/stats?hours=24
```

### Agent Memory
```bash
# 1. First query
curl -X POST https://api.wildfireranch.us/ask \
  -d '{"message": "What is my battery?"}' \
  → Returns session_id

# 2. Follow-up (same session)
curl -X POST https://api.wildfireranch.us/ask \
  -d '{"message": "How does that compare to earlier?",
       "session_id": "uuid-from-above"}'
  → Agent remembers!

# 3. New conversation (no session_id)
curl -X POST https://api.wildfireranch.us/ask \
  -d '{"message": "What was my battery in our first conversation?"}'
  → Agent recalls previous conversations!
```
