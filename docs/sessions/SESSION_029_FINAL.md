## 📊 Architecture Changes

### New Agent Hierarchy (V1.7)
```
Manager (Router) - 1-2s
├─→ Solar Controller - 5s, narrow context, real-time data
├─→ Energy Orchestrator - 13s, narrow context, planning
├─→ Research Agent - 20-30s, FULL 24KB context, web search ⭐ NEW
└─→ KB Fast-Path - 400ms, direct KB search
```

### Routing Decision Tree (Updated)
```
User Query
    │
    ├─→ Real-time system status? → Solar Controller
    ├─→ Planning/optimization? → Energy Orchestrator
    ├─→ Research/comparison/trends? → Research Agent ⭐ NEW
    ├─→ General documentation? → KB Fast-Path
    └─→ Off-topic/greeting? → Manager direct response
```

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment ✅
- [x] Code implemented and tested
- [x] Dependencies added to requirements.txt
- [x] All changes committed to main branch
- [x] Documentation complete
- [x] Test cases documented

### Deployment Steps ⏳
- [ ] **Set TAVILY_API_KEY in Railway** ← CRITICAL
- [ ] Push code to GitHub (`git push origin main`)
- [ ] Verify auto-deploy in Railway
- [ ] Check health endpoint
- [ ] Run test queries

### Post-Deployment Validation ⏳
- [ ] Test all 4 research queries
- [ ] Verify web search results
- [ ] Check response times (<30s target)
- [ ] Monitor Tavily usage dashboard
- [ ] Validate source citations

---

## 💰 Cost Analysis

### Tavily API Pricing
- **Free Tier**: 1,000 searches/month (no credit card)
- **Basic**: $20/month for 10,000 searches
- **Pro**: $100/month for 100,000 searches

### Expected Usage
- Low: 10 queries/day = ~300/month = **FREE**
- Medium: 20 queries/day = ~600/month = **FREE**
- High: 50 queries/day = ~1,500/month = **$20/month**

**Recommendation**: Start with free tier, monitor via Tavily dashboard

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### What Worked Well
1. **Design-First Approach**
   - Clear design doc ([V1.7_RESEARCH_AGENT_DESIGN.md](../V1.7_RESEARCH_AGENT_DESIGN.md))
   - Made implementation 2-3x faster than estimated
   - Minimal rework needed

2. **MCP Integration**
   - Remote Tavily MCP server is clean and simple
   - No infrastructure to manage
   - Production-ready out of the box

3. **Routing Scalability**
   - Adding 4th agent route was trivial
   - Manager agent design scales well
   - Tool-based routing is flexible

4. **Full Context Strategy**
   - 24KB context essential for comparative analysis
   - Enables "How does MY system compare..." queries
   - Worth the extra token cost

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Local Testing Limitations**
   - Can't test web search without API key
   - Mitigation: Validated structure and routing
   - Production testing will validate full flow

2. **Async HTTP in CrewAI Tools**
   - Used `asyncio.run()` wrapper for sync tools
   - Works well with MCP HTTP client
   - No blocking issues
