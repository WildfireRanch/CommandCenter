---

## üìã Task Checklist

### Phase 1: Manual Testing (60 min)

#### 1.1 Start Services
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd railway
uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload

# Terminal 2 - Frontend (optional - can use deployed version)
cd dashboards
streamlit run Home.py
```

#### 1.2 Test Agent Chat Page
**Access**: http://localhost:8501 (local) or deployed Streamlit dashboard

**Test Queries:**

1. **Status Query** (‚Üí Solar Controller)
   - Query: "What's my battery level?"
   - Expected: Battery percentage, solar/load/grid data
   - Verify: Agent role shows "Solar Controller" or "Energy Systems Monitor"

2. **Planning Query** (‚Üí Energy Orchestrator)
   - Query: "Should we run the miners right now?"
   - Expected: Recommendation with reasoning
   - Verify: Agent role shows "Energy Orchestrator" or "Energy Operations Manager"

3. **KB Query** (‚Üí Knowledge Base)
   - Query: "What is the minimum battery SOC threshold?"
   - Expected: Information from KB with source citations
   - Verify: Response mentions sources or policies

4. **Multi-Turn Conversation**
   - First: "What's my battery level?"
   - Then: "Is that good?" or "What about now?"
   - Expected: Agent maintains context, references previous answer

5. **Edge Cases**
   - Empty query (should reject gracefully)
   - Very long query (should handle or truncate)
   - Unclear query like "Help me" (should ask for clarification)

#### 1.3 Test Conversation Persistence
- Send several messages
- Note the session ID displayed
- Refresh page
- Verify conversation history persists
- Check "Load Conversation" button works

#### 1.4 Test Error Handling
- Stop backend (simulate downtime)
- Try sending message
- Verify: Clear error message shown (not silent failure)
- Restart backend and verify recovery

---

### Phase 2: Performance Testing (30 min)

#### 2.1 Response Time Benchmarks
Test 10 queries and measure response times:

**Acceptable Targets:**
- Simple status query: < 10 seconds
- Planning query: < 20 seconds
- KB search: < 15 seconds

**Record Results:**
```markdown
| Query Type | Time (s) | Agent Used | Status |
|------------|----------|------------|--------|
| Battery level | X.X | Solar Controller | ‚úÖ/‚ùå |
| Run miners? | X.X | Energy Orchestrator | ‚úÖ/‚ùå |
| Min SOC? | X.X | KB Search | ‚úÖ/‚ùå |
```

#### 2.2 Identify Bottlenecks
If any queries are slow (>30s):
- Check backend logs for long-running operations
- Verify OpenAI API response times
- Check database query performance
- Consider caching strategies

---

### Phase 3: UI Polish (Optional - 45 min)

#### 3.1 Enhanced Agent Display
**Current**: Shows agent role in caption
**Enhancement**: Add agent avatar/icon, better formatting

**File**: `dashboards/pages/3_ü§ñ_Agent_Chat.py`

```python
# After displaying response, show agent metadata better:
if "agent_role" in response:
    agent_icons = {
        "Solar Controller": "‚òÄÔ∏è",
        "Energy Orchestrator": "‚ö°",
        "Manager": "üéØ"
    }
    icon = agent_icons.get(response["agent_role"], "ü§ñ")
    st.caption(f"{icon} Answered by: **{response['agent_role']}**")
```

#### 3.2 Better Loading States
```python
# Instead of generic "Thinking..."
with st.spinner(f"Analyzing your query..."):
    response = api.ask_agent(...)

# Could show:
# - "Routing to specialist agent..."
# - "Checking current status..."
# - "Searching knowledge base..."
```

#### 3.3 Source Citations (if KB used)
If response contains KB citations, display them nicely:
```python
# Check if response has citations
if "Source:" in agent_reply or "source" in agent_reply.lower():
    with st.expander("üìö Sources"):
        st.info("Response includes information from knowledge base")
```

---

### Phase 4: Production Validation (15 min)

#### 4.1 Review Deployment Status
Check all services are deployed and healthy:

**Railway Services:**
- [ ] `CommandCenter` (API): https://api.wildfireranch.us
- [ ] `postgres_db` (Database): Internal connection working
- [ ] `dashboards` (Streamlit): Deployed URL working

**Vercel:**
- [ ] Next.js Frontend: Deployed and accessible
- [ ] MCP Server: Deployed and accessible

#### 4.2 Test Production Endpoints
```bash
# Health check
curl https://api.wildfireranch.us/health

# Ask endpoint (should require API key in production, or be public)
curl -X POST https://api.wildfireranch.us/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What is my battery level?"}'
```

#### 4.3 Verify Database Persistence
- Check Railway logs for database connections
- Verify conversations are being stored
- Check that no errors in logs

---

## üé® Optional Enhancements (If Time Permits)

### Enhancement 1: Agent Response Streaming
**What**: Stream agent responses token-by-token instead of waiting for complete response
**Effort**: 1-2 hours (requires SSE or WebSocket implementation)
**Value**: Better UX for long responses

### Enhancement 2: Performance Monitoring
**What**: Add response time tracking to database
**Effort**: 30 minutes
**Value**: Can analyze performance over time

```python
# In main.py /ask endpoint, already tracking duration_ms
# Could add performance_metrics table to track:
# - Average response time per agent
# - Slow query detection
# - Tool usage statistics
```

### Enhancement 3: Context Passing to Child Agents
**What**: Allow routing tools to pass conversation context to child agents
**Effort**: 2-3 hours (requires redesign)
**Complexity**: Medium-High
**Value**: Better multi-turn conversations with specialists

**Approach**:
- Store context in thread-local or request-scoped state
- Modify routing tools to access context
- Pass to child crew creation functions

## üìä Success Criteria

Session 022 is complete when:

### Must Have:
- [ ] Manual testing completed for all agent types
- [ ] All test queries return valid responses
- [ ] Response times acceptable (< 30s)
- [ ] Error handling works gracefully
- [ ] Production deployment verified healthy

### Nice to Have:
- [ ] UI polish implemented
- [ ] Performance benchmarks documented
- [ ] Optional enhancements considered/implemented

### Documentation:
- [ ] Create SESSION_022_SUMMARY.md
- [ ] Document any issues found and resolved
- [ ] Update V1.5 completion status
- [ ] Tag release (if ready)

---

## üêõ Known Limitations (Acceptable for V1.5)

These are **documented limitations**, not bugs:

1. **Context Not Passed to Child Agents**
   - Manager has context, but when routing to Solar Controller/Orchestrator, context is lost
   - Acceptable because each agent still has KB access for policies
   - Future enhancement if multi-turn specialist conversations needed

2. **No Real-Time Updates**
   - Dashboard doesn't auto-refresh energy data
   - User must manually refresh or re-query
   - Deferred to V2 (WebSocket implementation)

3. **No Miner/Hardware Control Yet**
   - Tools created but not integrated with actual hardware
   - Safe default: returns "not implemented" rather than making changes
   - Requires careful testing before production use

---

## üöÄ Post-Session 022 Options

### Option A: Ship V1.5 Now
If testing shows system is stable:
- Tag release: `git tag v1.5.0`
- Update README with "Production Ready" status
- Start using system daily
- Monitor for issues

### Option B: Additional Polish (Session 023)
If testing reveals needed improvements:
- Fix any issues found

- Then ship

### Option C: Start V2.0 Planning
Begin planning next major features:
- Real hardware integration (miners, Shelly, Victron)
- Real-time WebSocket updates
- Mobile app
- Advanced analytics
- Multi-user support

---

---

## üí° Testing Tips

### Good Test Queries
- Be specific: "What's my battery level?" not "Tell me about power"
- Test edge cases: very long queries, unclear intent
- Test follow-ups: "Is that good?" after status query
- Test errors: invalid input, backend down

### What to Look For
- ‚úÖ Correct agent routing
- ‚úÖ Accurate information
- ‚úÖ Source citations (when applicable)
- ‚úÖ Error messages (not crashes)
- ‚úÖ Reasonable response times
- ‚úÖ Conversation persistence

### Red Flags
- ‚ùå Wrong agent answering query
- ‚ùå TypeErrors or exceptions
- ‚ùå Silent failures
- ‚ùå Response times > 60s
- ‚ùå Lost conversation history
