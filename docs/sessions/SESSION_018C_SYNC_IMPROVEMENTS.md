# Session 018C - KB Sync Improvements & Multi-Format Support

**Date:** October 8, 2025
**Session Focus:** Sync debugging, PDF/Sheets support, and production testing
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

---

## üéØ Session Objectives

1. ‚úÖ Debug and fix sync issues (empty file threshold, smart sync)
2. ‚úÖ Add support for PDF documents
3. ‚úÖ Add support for Google Sheets
4. ‚úÖ Improve sync logging and error handling
5. ‚úÖ Complete end-to-end production testing

---

## üîç Issues Discovered & Fixed

### Issue 1: New Files Not Syncing
**Problem:** User added a "test" file to CONTEXT folder but it wasn't appearing after sync.

**Root Cause:** The sync code had a minimum content threshold of 10 characters. Files with less than 10 characters were skipped as "empty."

**Solution:**
- Changed threshold from 10 to 0 characters
- Now only truly empty files are skipped
- Added detailed logging to show file content length

**Files Changed:**
- `railway/src/kb/sync.py` - Updated empty file check

---

### Issue 2: Smart Sync Verification Needed
**Problem:** Uncertainty about whether smart sync was properly detecting changed files.

**Root Cause:** Lack of detailed logging made it impossible to verify smart sync behavior.

**Solution:**
- Added comprehensive logging for all sync decisions:
  - "New file detected" for files not in database
  - "File changed" with timestamps for modified files
  - "Skipping unchanged file" with timestamps for unmodified files

**Files Changed:**
- `railway/src/kb/sync.py` - Enhanced logging

---

### Issue 3: Only Google Docs Being Synced
**Problem:** 7 PDFs and 1 Spreadsheet in Google Drive were ignored during sync.

**Root Cause:** Sync code only filtered for `application/vnd.google-apps.document` mime type.

**Solution:**
- Expanded supported mime types to include:
  - Google Docs: `application/vnd.google-apps.document`
  - PDFs: `application/pdf`
  - Google Sheets: `application/vnd.google-apps.spreadsheet`
- Added content extraction for each type
- Updated database schema to store `mime_type`

**Files Changed:**
- `railway/requirements.txt` - Added pypdf library
- `railway/src/kb/google_drive.py` - Added PDF and Sheets extraction functions
- `railway/src/kb/sync.py` - Updated file type filtering and content fetching
- `railway/src/database/migrations/001_knowledge_base.sql` - Added mime_type column

---

### Issue 4: Railway Deployment Failure
**Problem:** Railway deployment failed when copying requirements.txt.

**Root Cause:** Initially used `PyPDF2==3.0.1` and `pdfplumber==0.11.4` which had compatibility issues.

**Solution:**
- Switched to `pypdf==4.0.0` (modern, maintained library)
- Removed pdfplumber (not needed)
- Updated import from `PyPDF2.PdfReader` to `pypdf.PdfReader`

**Files Changed:**
- `railway/requirements.txt` - Updated PDF library
- `railway/src/kb/google_drive.py` - Updated import

---

### Issue 5: Database Transaction Error
**Problem:** Smart sync failed with "current transaction is aborted" error.

**Root Cause:** Sync tried to INSERT with `mime_type` column before it existed in database.

**Solution:**
- Added `mime_type` and `folder_path` columns to schema
- Updated `001_knowledge_base.sql` migration file
- Ran `init-schema` endpoint to apply migration
- Added fallback logic in sync for databases without new columns

**Files Changed:**
- `railway/src/database/migrations/001_knowledge_base.sql` - Added columns
- `railway/src/kb/sync.py` - Added fallback error handling

---

## üöÄ New Features Implemented

### PDF Document Support

**What:** Extract text content from PDF files in Google Drive

**How:**
- Download PDF via Drive API `get_media()`
- Extract text using `pypdf.PdfReader`
- Process page by page
- Store like any other document

**Benefits:**
- Equipment manuals (7 PDFs in SolarShack folder) now searchable
- Technical documentation accessible to agents
- No manual conversion needed

**Implementation:**
```python
def fetch_pdf_content(drive_service, file_id: str) -> str:
    # Download PDF from Drive
    request = drive_service.files().get_media(fileId=file_id)
    # Extract text with pypdf
    pdf_reader = PdfReader(file_content)
    # Return full text
```

---

### Google Sheets Support

**What:** Extract data from Google Spreadsheets and convert to text

**How:**
- Use Sheets API to get spreadsheet metadata
- Iterate through all sheets in workbook
- Fetch cell values via `values().get()`
- Format as pipe-separated text (CSV-like)

**Benefits:**
- Financial models (Wildfire.Green) now searchable
- Data tables accessible to agents
- Structured data queryable via embeddings

**Implementation:**
```python
def fetch_spreadsheet_content(drive_service, file_id: str) -> str:
    sheets_service = build('sheets', 'v4', credentials=credentials)
    # Get all sheets
    spreadsheet = sheets_service.spreadsheets().get(spreadsheetId=file_id)
    # Extract values from each sheet
    # Format as text
```

---

### Enhanced Sync Logging

**What:** Detailed logging for every sync decision

**Why:** Debug sync behavior and verify smart sync works correctly

**Logs Added:**
- File type counts at start: "Found X Google Docs, Y PDFs, Z Spreadsheets"
- New file detection: "New file detected: filename (not in database)"
- Change detection: "File changed: filename (last_synced: X, modified: Y)"
- Skip decisions: "Skipping unchanged file: filename (last_synced: X, modified: Y)"
- Content size: "Document filename has X characters"
- Errors: "Failed to fetch content for filename: error"

## üéì Lessons Learned

### 1. Progressive Enhancement
Started with Google Docs only, then added PDFs and Sheets. Each file type has different extraction methods but same storage/embedding pipeline.

### 2. Graceful Degradation
Added fallback logic for databases without new columns. Allows code to deploy before schema migration runs.

### 3. Logging is Critical
Detailed logging made debugging 10x faster. Can see exactly why files are skipped or what errors occur.

### 4. Library Selection Matters
`PyPDF2` had issues, `pypdf` worked perfectly. Research current best practices, not just "popular" libraries.

### 5. Database Migrations in Production
Railway auto-deploys code but not schema changes. Need manual migration run via `init-schema` endpoint.
