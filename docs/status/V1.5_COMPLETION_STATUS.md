## 🎯 Known Limitations (Acceptable for V1.5)

These are **documented design decisions**, not bugs:

### 1. Context Not Passed to Child Agents
**What:** When Manager routes to Solar Controller or Energy Orchestrator, conversation context is not passed.

**Why:** CrewAI routing tools only receive query parameter, not context. Would require significant redesign.

**Impact:** Low - Each agent has KB access for policies, and most queries are self-contained.

**Future:** V2 could implement state-based context passing if needed.

---

### 2. No Real-Time Updates
**What:** Dashboard doesn't auto-refresh energy data.

**Why:** Would require WebSocket implementation for push updates.

**Impact:** Low - Users can manually refresh or re-query.

**Future:** V2 feature - WebSocket real-time updates.

---

### 3. Hardware Control Not Enabled
**What:** Miner coordinator and battery optimizer return recommendations but don't execute.

**Why:** Safety - requires careful testing and user confirmation.

**Impact:** Low - System still provides valuable recommendations.

**Future:** V2 feature - Actual hardware control with safeguards.

---

## 🚀 V1.5 vs V2.0

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### 1. Test Early, Test Often
**Lesson:** Session 020 built lots of code without testing, leading to 10 bugs discovered later.

**Better Approach:** Test each component as it's built. Session 021 proved that testing catches issues early.

---

### 2. Tool Calling Pattern is Critical
**Lesson:** CrewAI's `@tool` decorator requires `.func()` for direct calls. Not understanding this caused TypeErrors.

**Solution:** Document patterns clearly in style guide. Create examples.

---

### 3. Agent Reuse Matters
**Lesson:** Creating agents is expensive. Early code created agents twice per request.

**Solution:** Pass agent instances to task functions. Reuse wherever possible.

---

### 4. Metadata for Multi-Agent Systems
**Lesson:** When routing between agents, need to know who actually answered.

**Solution:** Return structured JSON with metadata from routing tools.

---

### 5. Documentation Prevents Future Bugs
**Lesson:** Undocumented patterns lead to inconsistent implementations.

**Solution:** Document conventions in style guide. Update as patterns emerge.

---

## 📞 Next Steps

### Immediate (Session 022)
1. **Manual Testing** - Test all agent types with real queries
2. **Performance Validation** - Ensure acceptable response times
3. **UI Polish** (Optional) - Improve chat interface
4. **Production Verification** - Confirm all services healthy

### Short Term (Week 1)
1. **Daily Use** - Use system for actual energy management
2. **Monitor** - Watch for any issues or bugs
3. **Collect Feedback** - Note what works well, what needs improvement
4. **Minor Fixes** - Address any small issues found

### Medium Term (Month 1)
1. **V2 Planning** - Define scope for hardware control features
2. **User Research** - Identify most valuable enhancements
3. **Architecture Review** - Plan for real-time updates
4. **Security Audit** - Ensure production security best practices
