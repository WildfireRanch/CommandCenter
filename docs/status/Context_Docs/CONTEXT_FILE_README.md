## üéØ Why This File is Important

### For AI Agents (in Google Docs KB)
When you sync this file to your Google Docs Knowledge Base, AI agents working with CommandCenter will be able to:

1. **Understand the system architecture** without reading dozens of files
2. **Know which endpoints to call** for specific tasks
3. **Understand agent routing logic** (when to use which agent)
4. **Access troubleshooting guides** for common issues
5. **Learn best practices** for working with the codebase
6. **Get quick answers** about design decisions and trade-offs

### For You (System Owner)
- **Single source of truth** for high-level system understanding
- **Share with team members** or contractors easily
- **Remember design decisions** months later
- **Guide AI assistants** working in this codebase

## üì§ How to Use This File

### Step 1: Sync to Google Docs Knowledge Base

**Option A: Manual Copy (Immediate)**
1. Open the file: [CONTEXT_CommandCenter_System.md](CONTEXT_CommandCenter_System.md)
2. Copy entire contents
3. Create new Google Doc in your `COMMAND_CENTER/CONTEXT/` folder
4. Name it: "CommandCenter_System_Context"
5. Paste contents
6. Run manual sync from dashboard

**Option B: Automated Sync (Recommended)**
1. Move this file to your Google Drive sync folder location
2. The system will auto-detect it as a context file (CONTEXT folder)
3. It will be marked as `is_context_file = TRUE` in database
4. Always loaded for agent queries

### Step 2: Verify Sync

Check that the file was synced:

```bash
curl https://api.wildfireranch.us/kb/stats | jq
```

You should see:
- Document count increased by 1
- Token count increased significantly (~15,000-20,000 tokens)

Check if it's flagged as context file:

```sql
SELECT title, is_context_file, token_count
FROM kb_documents
WHERE title LIKE '%CommandCenter%System%';
```

### Step 3: Test Agent Access

Ask an agent a system question:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.wildfireranch.us/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Explain the CommandCenter architecture"}' | jq
```

The agent should reference information from the context file.

## üîÑ Keeping It Updated

### When to Update

Update this context file when:

1. **Major version releases** (V1.6, V2.0, etc.)
2. **Architecture changes** (new agents, new routing logic)
3. **API endpoint changes** (new endpoints, modified responses)
4. **Performance optimizations** (new metrics, improved response times)
5. **Configuration changes** (new environment variables)

### How to Update

1. **Edit the markdown file** in this repo
2. **Copy to Google Docs** (or wait for auto-sync)
3. **Run manual sync** from dashboard to update embeddings
4. **Verify** with test query

### Version Control

The file includes version info at the top:
```markdown
**Version:** 1.5.0 (Production)
**Last Updated:** December 10, 2025
```

Update these when you make changes.

## üìä What This File Replaces

Before this context file, agents had to search through:

- V1.5_MASTER_REFERENCE.md (quick facts, current state)
- 05-architecture.md (detailed architecture)
- ORCHESTRATION_LAYER_DESIGN.md (agent design)
- 06-knowledge-base-design.md (KB system)
- V2_Roadmap.md (future plans)
- Multiple session summaries (historical decisions)

Now, agents have **one comprehensive document** that covers all of this.

### What This File Does NOT Replace

This is a **context file**, not detailed documentation. For deep dives, agents should still consult:

- **V1.5_MASTER_REFERENCE.md** - Detailed current state reference
- **Code files** - Actual implementation details
- **Session summaries** - Development history and decisions
- **API docs** - Interactive OpenAPI documentation

---

## üé® Structure Design Choices

### Why Markdown Format?
- **Google Docs compatible** (paste directly)
- **Readable by AI** (LLMs parse markdown well)
- **Version controllable** (git-friendly)
- **Easy to update** (no complex formatting)

### Why This Organization?
The file is organized by:

1. **High-level first** (overview, architecture)
2. **Core systems second** (agents, KB, data)
3. **Technical details third** (API, deployment, troubleshooting)
4. **Reference material last** (roadmap, decisions, stats)

This matches how AI agents typically consume information: broad understanding first, then drill down as needed.

### Why Include Examples?
Every section includes:
- **Code examples** (curl commands, SQL queries)
- **Expected responses** (what should happen)
- **Use cases** (when to use which feature)

This helps agents understand not just WHAT exists, but HOW to use it.

## üí° Pro Tips

### For Best Results

1. **Keep it in CONTEXT folder** (Tier 1 knowledge)
   - Always loaded by agents
   - No search delay
   - Highest priority

2. **Use semantic section headers**
   - Makes KB search more effective
   - Agents can find specific sections quickly

3. **Include negative examples**
   - "What NOT to do" is as valuable as "what to do"
   - Prevents common mistakes

4. **Update stats regularly**
   - Real numbers are more useful than placeholders
   - Shows system growth over time

5. **Link to detailed docs**
   - Context file is overview, not encyclopedia
   - Deep links guide agents to specifics when needed
