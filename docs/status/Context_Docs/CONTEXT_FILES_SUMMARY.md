### Step 2: Sync to Google Docs

**For CONTEXT_CommandCenter_System.md (Primary):**

1. Open your Google Drive `COMMAND_CENTER/CONTEXT/` folder
2. Create new Google Doc: "CommandCenter System Context"
3. Copy entire contents of CONTEXT_CommandCenter_System.md
4. Paste into Google Doc
5. Run manual sync from dashboard: https://dashboard.wildfireranch.us/kb

**For QUICK_REFERENCE_CommandCenter.md (Optional but Recommended):**

1. Create Google Doc: "CommandCenter Quick Reference"
2. Place in `CONTEXT/` folder (or main folder)
3. Copy and paste contents
4. Run manual sync

**For CONTEXT_FILE_README.md (Optional):**

1. Keep in GitHub primarily
2. Optionally create Google Doc if you want it in KB
3. Useful for team members or future reference

### Step 3: Verify Sync

```bash
# Check KB stats increased
curl https://api.wildfireranch.us/kb/stats | jq

# Check for new documents
curl https://api.wildfireranch.us/kb/documents | jq '.data[] | select(.title | contains("CommandCenter"))'

# Test agent can access
curl -X POST https://api.wildfireranch.us/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Explain the CommandCenter architecture"}' | jq
```

## 📚 What This Replaces

### Before These Context Files
Agents had to search through:
- V1.5_MASTER_REFERENCE.md (current state)
- 05-architecture.md (detailed architecture)
- ORCHESTRATION_LAYER_DESIGN.md (agent design)
- 06-knowledge-base-design.md (KB system)
- 07-knowledge-base-sync.md (sync process)
- V2_Roadmap.md (future plans)
- Multiple session summaries (historical context)
- INDEX.md (navigation)

**Result:** Fragmented knowledge, slower context building, potential inconsistencies

### After These Context Files
Agents have:
- **CONTEXT_CommandCenter_System.md** - One comprehensive reference
- **QUICK_REFERENCE_CommandCenter.md** - Fast fact lookup
- **Original detailed docs** - For deep dives when needed

**Result:** Faster understanding, consistent responses, better accuracy
