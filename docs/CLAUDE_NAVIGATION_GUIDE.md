# Claude Navigation Guide for CommandCenter

**Purpose:** Guide Claude Code/AI assistants to navigate CommandCenter documentation efficiently
**Last Updated:** December 10, 2025 (V1.5.0 Release)

---

## üéØ Quick Start for AI Assistants

When working with CommandCenter, **ALWAYS start here:**

### 1. **First Thing to Read**
```
docs/V1.5_MASTER_REFERENCE.md
```
This is the **PRIMARY REFERENCE** for current system state. Contains:
- Architecture diagram
- All API endpoints
- Database schema
- Active agents and tools
- Environment variables
- Quick troubleshooting

**Read this FIRST before answering questions about current system.**

### 2. **Second Thing to Check**
```
docs/INDEX.md
```
Complete documentation index showing where everything is located.

## üö´ What NOT to Read (Unless Necessary)

### **archive/** Folder
Historical documentation - only read if:
- User asks about history/decisions
- Need to understand why something was built certain way
- Researching evolution of a feature

**Don't read archive/ for current system state!**

### **sessions/** Folder
Development history - only read if:
- User asks about specific session
- Need implementation details from when feature was built
- Debugging something that broke recently

**Don't read all sessions! Use INDEX.md to find relevant one.**

## üé® Best Practices for AI Assistants

### DO:
‚úÖ Always read V1.5_MASTER_REFERENCE.md first
‚úÖ Use INDEX.md to find specific docs
‚úÖ Check folder READMEs before diving into files
‚úÖ Prefer current docs over archive
‚úÖ Reference file paths in answers (e.g., `railway/src/agents/manager.py:42`)
‚úÖ Use markdown links for file references: `[filename](path/to/file)`

### DON'T:
‚ùå Read entire sessions/ folder linearly
‚ùå Start with archive/ unless user asks for history
‚ùå Assume old docs are current
‚ùå Skip V1.5_MASTER_REFERENCE.md
‚ùå Read all files before answering simple questions
‚ùå Ignore folder structure/organization

## üîß Troubleshooting Navigation Issues

### "I can't find documentation about X"
1. Check INDEX.md
2. Check V1.5_MASTER_REFERENCE.md table of contents
3. Check relevant folder README.md
4. If still not found, check archive/ (may be deprecated)

### "Documentation seems outdated"
1. Check date in file header
2. If older than V1.5 release (Dec 2025), check archive/
3. Prefer V1.5_MASTER_REFERENCE.md for current state

### "Too many session files to search"
1. Use INDEX.md "Session History" section
2. Session summaries grouped by topic
3. Only read specific session if needed

### "Conflicting information in different docs"
1. V1.5_MASTER_REFERENCE.md is authoritative
2. Older docs may contain historical info
3. Check file dates to determine current state

## üí¨ Communication Tips

### When Answering Questions
- Always cite file locations: `See railway/src/agents/manager.py:42`
- Use markdown links: `[Manager Agent](railway/src/agents/manager.py)`
- Reference doc sections: "Per V1.5_MASTER_REFERENCE.md, the KB fast-path..."
- Be specific about current vs. historical info

### When Suggesting Changes
- Follow code style guide
- Reference existing patterns from V1.5_MASTER_REFERENCE.md
- Point to similar implementations in codebase
- Consider impact on documented architecture

### When Unsure
- Say "Let me check the documentation..."
- Read relevant section
- Provide answer with source citation
- Better to take 30 seconds to check than give wrong info

## üìù Summary

**Golden Rule:** V1.5_MASTER_REFERENCE.md is your primary source for current system state.

**Navigation Hierarchy:**
1. V1.5_MASTER_REFERENCE.md (current state)
2. Specific component docs (05-08, ORCHESTRATION)
3. Guides/reference folders (how-to)
4. Sessions (recent implementation)
5. Archive (historical context)

**Key Principle:** Start specific (primary reference), expand as needed. Don't read everything to answer simple questions.
