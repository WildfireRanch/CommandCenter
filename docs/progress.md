## Session Log

### Session 1 - October 1, 2025
**Type:** Environment Setup & Discovery  
**Duration:** ~2 hours  
**Completed:**
- Created project structure
- Set up Python/CrewAI environment
- Learned: venv, .gitignore, git undo/force push
- **Completed comprehensive Relay repo audit**
- Identified 258 files in Relay, ~10-15% worth porting
- Defined clear V1 scope (5 core features)
- Learned root causes of Relay fragility

**Key Insights:**
- Relay's hardware tools work well (direct APIs)
- Custom orchestration is the problem (CrewAI solves this)
- "More ideas than success" = need MVP discipline
- Mystery code = only port what's understood

**Next Session:**
- Phase 1.2: Define detailed requirements
- Map Relay tools to extract
- Create port plan

### Session 7 - October 5, 2025
**Type:** Database Schema Initialization
**Duration:** ~45 minutes
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE - DATABASE FULLY OPERATIONAL**

**Completed:**
- Created comprehensive database schema (5 tables)
- Enabled TimescaleDB hypertables for time-series data
- Enabled pgvector for semantic search embeddings
- Wired Solar Controller agent to database
- All conversations now persisted automatically
- API endpoints for conversation retrieval
- End-to-end testing successful

**Tables Created:**
- `agent.conversations` - Conversation metadata
- `agent.messages` - Message storage (hypertable)
- `agent.memory` - Long-term memory with vectors
- `agent.logs` - System events (hypertable)
- `solark.plant_flow` - Energy data (hypertable)

**New API Endpoints:**
- `POST /db/init-schema` - Run migrations
- `GET /db/schema-status` - Verify schema
- `GET /conversations` - List conversations
- `GET /conversations/{id}` - Get conversation details

**Technical Wins:**
- Solved TimescaleDB composite PK constraints
- Idempotent migrations with exception handling
- JSONB type adaptation for metadata
- Auto-updating message counts via triggers
- Full conversation history retrieval

**What's Working:**
- User query → Database storage → Response
- Conversation persistence
- Message tracking with timing
- Event logging
- API retrieval

**Production URL:** https://api.wildfireranch.us

**Next Session:**
- Consider MCP server integration
- Add conversation search/filtering
- Implement summarization
- Frontend UI for history

### Session 8 - October 5, 2025 (Continued)
**Type:** Agent Memory + Energy Data Persistence
**Duration:** ~60 minutes
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE - TWO MAJOR FEATURES**

**Part 1: Energy Data Persistence**
- Created SolArk data storage utilities
- Auto-save every agent query to database
- New API endpoints: /energy/latest, /energy/recent, /energy/stats
- TimescaleDB hypertables for time-series optimization
- Historical tracking now operational

**Part 2: Agent Memory System**
- Conversation context retrieval from database
- Multi-turn conversation support (session_id)
- Agent recalls past 3 conversations automatically
- Tested successfully: "What was my battery in our first conversation?" → "18%" ✅

---

### Session 9-10 - October 5, 2025
**Type:** MCP Server + Frontend Deployment
**Duration:** ~3 hours
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE - VERCEL DEPLOYMENT**

**Completed:**
- MCP Server deployed to Vercel (Claude Desktop integration)
- Next.js Frontend deployed to Vercel with 7 pages
- Integration with Railway API successful
- Real-time energy monitoring working
- Home dashboard with live battery/solar stats

---

### Session 11-12 - October 5, 2025
**Type:** CrewAI Studio Deployment
**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE - RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT**

**Completed:**
- Resolved git submodule issue (62 files, 5,874 lines added)
- Created Railway deployment configs
- Fixed Railway PORT variable handling
- CrewAI Studio deployed successfully
- Comprehensive deployment documentation created

---

### Session 13 - October 6, 2025
**Type:** Railway PORT Fix
**Duration:** ~15 minutes
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE - STREAMLIT PORT ISSUE RESOLVED**

**Issue:** `$PORT` being treated as literal string instead of expanded
**Root Cause:** Railway provides `DATABASE_URL` not `DB_URL`, Streamlit reading literal `$PORT`
**Solution:**
- Updated db_utils.py to check both `DB_URL` and `DATABASE_URL`
- Modified start.sh to unset `STREAMLIT_SERVER_PORT` and use `--server.port=$PORT` directly
- Removed conflicting environment variable

**Result:** ✅ CrewAI Studio now deploying successfully on Railway

**Production Status:** 🟢 ALL SERVICES OPERATIONAL
- API: https://api.wildfireranch.us ✅
- Frontend: Vercel deployment ✅
- MCP Server: Vercel deployment ✅
- CrewAI Studio: https://studio.wildfireranch.us ✅
- Database: PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB ✅

### Session 014 - October 6, 2025
**Type:** CrewAI Studio Production Deployment + Integration
**Duration:** ~3 hours
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE - CREWAI STUDIO DEPLOYED**

**Major Issues Resolved:**
1. **Railway PORT Error** (Sessions 012-014)
   - Root cause: Hidden `STREAMLIT_SERVER_PORT=$PORT` service variable
   - Solution: Deleted variable from Railway dashboard
   - Result: Streamlit starts cleanly on port 8080

2. **Dockerfile Path Issues**
   - Root cause: Railway couldn't find Dockerfile in subdirectory
   - Solution: Moved Dockerfile to repo root, cleared root directory setting
   - Result: Clean builds with proper file copying

3. **embedchain Module Error**
   - Root cause: Unpinned dependency installed incompatible version
   - Solution: Changed `embedchain` to `embedchain>=0.1.100`
   - Result: All imports working, Studio loads successfully

4. **Cross-Project Database Access**
   - Root cause: `postgres.railway.internal` only works within same project
   - Solution: Use public hostname for Studio: `postgresdb-production-e5ae.up.railway.app:5432`
   - Result: Full database integration across projects

**Configuration Established:**
- CrewAI Studio (CrewAI project) → PostgreSQL (CommandCenter project)
- Uses public DATABASE_URL for cross-project access
- Internal URLs for same-project services (API, Dashboards)
- Cost-efficient: internal traffic free, minimal external

**Deployments:**
- ✅ CrewAI Studio running on Railway port 8080
- ✅ Streamlit GUI accessible at studio.wildfireranch.us
- ✅ Database connection working
- ✅ Frontend Studio page ready (needs env var)

**Remaining Tasks (Next Session):**
- Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_STUDIO_URL=https://studio.wildfireranch.us` to Vercel
- Redeploy frontend
- Test full Studio integration end-to-end

**Key Learnings:**
- Railway service variables override everything - check dashboard first!
- Dockerfile at repo root is safest for Railway
- Cross-project database requires public hostname
- Always pin dependencies with version constraints

**Documentation Created:**
- SESSION_014_RAILWAY_PORT_RESOLUTION.md (PORT troubleshooting deep-dive)
- SESSION_014_FINAL_SUMMARY.md (Complete session summary)
- Updated progress.md and project configuration files
