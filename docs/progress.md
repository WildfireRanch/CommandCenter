## Key Findings from Audit

**Keep/Port:**
- ‚úÖ Hardware control tools (SolArk, Shelly, miners)
- ‚úÖ Frontend UI components
- ‚úÖ Agent role concepts

**Replace with CrewAI:**
- ‚ùå Custom orchestration ‚Üí CrewAI Crews
- ‚ùå Custom memory ‚Üí CrewAI Memory
- ‚ùå KB integration ‚Üí CrewAI RAG tools

**V1 Scope:**
1. Hardware Control Agent
2. Energy Orchestrator
3. Conversation Interface
4. Basic Knowledge Base
5. Simple Memory

## Session Log

### Session 1 - October 1, 2025
**Type:** Environment Setup & Discovery  
**Duration:** ~2 hours  
**Completed:**
- Created project structure
- Set up Python/CrewAI environment
- Learned: venv, .gitignore, git undo/force push
- **Completed comprehensive Relay repo audit**
- Identified 258 files in Relay, ~10-15% worth porting
- Defined clear V1 scope (5 core features)
- Learned root causes of Relay fragility

**Key Insights:**
- Relay's hardware tools work well (direct APIs)
- Custom orchestration is the problem (CrewAI solves this)
- "More ideas than success" = need MVP discipline
- Mystery code = only port what's understood

**Next Session:**
- Phase 1.2: Define detailed requirements
- Map Relay tools to extract
- Create port plan

### Session 7 - October 5, 2025
**Type:** Database Schema Initialization
**Duration:** ~45 minutes
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE - DATABASE FULLY OPERATIONAL**

**Completed:**
- Created comprehensive database schema (5 tables)
- Enabled TimescaleDB hypertables for time-series data
- Enabled pgvector for semantic search embeddings
- Wired Solar Controller agent to database
- All conversations now persisted automatically
- API endpoints for conversation retrieval
- End-to-end testing successful

**Tables Created:**
- `agent.conversations` - Conversation metadata
- `agent.messages` - Message storage (hypertable)
- `agent.memory` - Long-term memory with vectors
- `agent.logs` - System events (hypertable)
- `solark.plant_flow` - Energy data (hypertable)

**New API Endpoints:**
- `POST /db/init-schema` - Run migrations
- `GET /db/schema-status` - Verify schema
- `GET /conversations` - List conversations
- `GET /conversations/{id}` - Get conversation details

**Technical Wins:**
- Solved TimescaleDB composite PK constraints
- Idempotent migrations with exception handling
- JSONB type adaptation for metadata
- Auto-updating message counts via triggers
- Full conversation history retrieval

**What's Working:**
- User query ‚Üí Database storage ‚Üí Response
- Conversation persistence
- Message tracking with timing
- Event logging
- API retrieval

**Production URL:** https://api.wildfireranch.us

**Next Session:**
- Consider MCP server integration
- Add conversation search/filtering
- Implement summarization
- Frontend UI for history

### Session 8 - October 5, 2025 (Continued)
**Type:** Agent Memory + Energy Data Persistence
**Duration:** ~60 minutes
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE - TWO MAJOR FEATURES**

**Part 1: Energy Data Persistence**
- Created SolArk data storage utilities
- Auto-save every agent query to database
- New API endpoints: /energy/latest, /energy/recent, /energy/stats
- TimescaleDB hypertables for time-series optimization
- Historical tracking now operational

**Part 2: Agent Memory System**
- Conversation context retrieval from database
- Multi-turn conversation support (session_id)
- Agent recalls past 3 conversations automatically
- Tested successfully: "What was my battery in our first conversation?" ‚Üí "18%" ‚úÖ

**New Capabilities:**
- Agent has memory across sessions
- Natural multi-turn dialogue
- "Compare to earlier" queries work
- Historical energy data tracking
- Time-series analytics ready

**API Endpoints (Now 9 total):**
- POST /ask (updated: accepts session_id, returns session_id)
- GET /energy/latest (new)
- GET /energy/recent (new)
- GET /energy/stats (new)
- + 5 existing endpoints

**Test Results:**
- ‚úÖ Agent remembers: "Battery was 18% earlier, now 19%"
- ‚úÖ Cross-session recall: "Your battery was 18% in our first conversation"
- ‚úÖ Energy data: 2+ snapshots stored, stats working
- ‚úÖ Performance: ~4000ms with memory (acceptable)

**Production Status:** üü¢
- API: https://api.wildfireranch.us (healthy)
- Database: 2 energy snapshots, 5+ conversations
- Agent: Memory operational

**Next Session Priority:**
- **MCP Server** (45-60 min) - Use agent from Claude Desktop
- Or Frontend UI (90-120 min)
- Or Additional tools (30-60 min each)
