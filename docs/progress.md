## Session Log

### Session 1 - October 1, 2025
**Type:** Environment Setup & Discovery  
**Duration:** ~2 hours  
**Completed:**
- Created project structure
- Set up Python/CrewAI environment
- Learned: venv, .gitignore, git undo/force push
- **Completed comprehensive Relay repo audit**
- Identified 258 files in Relay, ~10-15% worth porting
- Defined clear V1 scope (5 core features)
- Learned root causes of Relay fragility

**Key Insights:**
- Relay's hardware tools work well (direct APIs)
- Custom orchestration is the problem (CrewAI solves this)
- "More ideas than success" = need MVP discipline
- Mystery code = only port what's understood

**Next Session:** 
- Phase 1.2: Define detailed requirements
- Map Relay tools to extract
- Create port plan
