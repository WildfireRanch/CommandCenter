# CommandCenter V1.9 Implementation Plan

**Version:** 1.9.0  
**Focus:** User Preferences & Voltage-Based Decision System  
**Timeline:** 3 weeks (15 working days)  
**Status:** Planning Complete, Ready for Implementation

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

V1.9 adds a **preference-driven decision layer** on top of existing V1.5 telemetry collection. Users can customize battery thresholds, miner priorities, and HVAC settings without code changes. All decisions use **voltage as ground truth** with optional SOC display.

**Key Innovation:** Voltage-first architecture - more accurate than SOC%, respects physics.

---

## 📊 Current State (V1.5)

### What's Already Working
- ✅ Victron integration (voltage, current, temp)
- ✅ SolArk integration (SOC, solar, load, generator)
- ✅ 3 agents (Manager, Solar Controller, Energy Orchestrator)
- ✅ Knowledge base (15 docs, 141K tokens)
- ✅ Conversation persistence
- ✅ Dashboard (Next.js + Vercel)
- ✅ API (FastAPI + Railway)
- ✅ Database (PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB)

### Limitations (V1.5)
- ❌ Hardcoded thresholds (20/40/60/80% SOC)
- ❌ Single miner strategy (can't manage multiple)
- ❌ No per-device voltage thresholds
- ❌ Fixed decision logic (can't customize without code changes)

---

## 🚀 V1.9 Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Voltage-Based Thresholds** - Replace SOC% with voltage (V) as decision input
2. **Multi-Miner Management** - Priority-based power allocation (primary + dump loads)
3. **HVAC Control Logic** - Temperature-based zone management
4. **User Customization** - All thresholds editable via UI

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Users can set battery thresholds in voltage OR SOC%
- ✅ System supports 3+ miners with different priorities
- ✅ HVAC zones trigger based on temperature thresholds
- ✅ Agents use user preferences (not hardcoded values)
- ✅ All existing V1.5 features continue working
- ✅ Zero data collection changes (uses existing telemetry)

├─ id, email, password_hash
├─ created_at, updated_at
└─ Single user for V1.9 (multi-user in V2)

## 🏗️ Architecture Changes

### Data Flow (V1.9)

```
Telemetry (V1.5 - Working)
├─ Victron: battery_voltage, battery_temp
├─ SolArk: pv_power, load_power, battery_soc
└─ PostgreSQL: solark.plant_flow (30s polling)
         ↓
Preferences (V1.9 - New)
├─ user_preferences: voltage thresholds
├─ miner_profiles: per-miner settings
└─ hvac_zones: temperature thresholds
         ↓
Decision Logic (V1.9 - Enhanced)
├─ Energy Orchestrator loads preferences
├─ Compares telemetry to user thresholds
├─ Returns personalized recommendations
└─ Uses voltage (not SOC) for decisions
         ↓
Response (V1.5 - Working)
└─ Agent responds with context-aware advice
```

### Key Integration Points

1. **Energy Orchestrator Agent** (`railway/src/agents/energy_orchestrator.py`)
   - Load user preferences on initialization
   - Pass preferences to tools
   - Use voltage thresholds in decision logic

2. **Battery Optimizer Tool** (`railway/src/tools/battery_optimizer.py`)
   - Accept voltage + user prefs as parameters
   - Compare current voltage to user thresholds
   - Return recommendations based on user strategy

3. **Miner Coordinator Tool** (`railway/src/tools/miner_coordinator.py`)
   - Evaluate all miner profiles in priority order
   - Allocate power budget by priority
   - Check voltage + solar constraints per miner

4. **New: Voltage-SOC Converter** (`railway/src/services/voltage_soc_converter.py`)
   - Bidirectional conversion (voltage ↔ SOC%)
   - Uses user's custom calibration curve
   - Enables dual display (show both units)

## 🔧 Technical Specifications

### Voltage Calibration (Key Innovation)

**Problem:** LiFePO4 batteries don't have linear voltage-SOC relationship  
**Solution:** User-defined calibration curve

```python
# User's calibration (from Sol-Ark specs)
voltage_curve = [
    {"soc": 0,   "voltage": 45.0},  # Empty (Batt Empty V + margin)
    {"soc": 15,  "voltage": 47.0},  # Low (Batt Low V)
    {"soc": 40,  "voltage": 50.0},  # Restart (Batt Restart)
    {"soc": 60,  "voltage": 52.0},  # Target (SmartLoad ON)
    {"soc": 80,  "voltage": 54.5},  # High (near Float)
    {"soc": 100, "voltage": 56.0},  # Full (user's 100%)
]

# Linear interpolation between points
def voltage_to_soc(voltage: float) -> float:
    # Find bracketing points and interpolate
    pass
```

### Miner Priority System

**Primary Miner (S21+ 235TH, 3,878W):**
- Priority: 1 (CRITICAL)
- Operating mode: Aggressive
- Voltage range: 50.0V - 56.0V (40% - 100% SOC)
- Strategy: Maximize revenue, run whenever safe

**Dump Load Miners (S19, S9):**
- Priority: 3-4 (OPPORTUNISTIC)
- Operating mode: Opportunistic
- Voltage range: 54.5V+ (>80% SOC only)
- Strategy: Scavenge excess solar, never compete with primary

**Power Allocation Logic:**
```
1. Calculate available power (solar + battery allowance)
2. Subtract house load (always priority)
3. Sort miners by priority (1 = highest)
4. For each miner in order:
   a. Check voltage threshold
   b. Check power budget remaining
   c. Check solar requirements (dump loads only)
   d. Allocate power if all checks pass
5. Return decisions for all miners
```

### HVAC Temperature Management

**Heat Room (Miner Area):**
- Cooling: Exhaust fan ON at 40°C, OFF at 35°C
- Heating: Miner (preferred) or heater at 0°C, OFF at 5°C
- Battery protection: Block charging below 0°C (LiFePO4 limit)

**Main Room (Equipment/General):**
- Cooling: Exhaust fan ON at 35°C, OFF at 30°C
- Heating: Heater only (miner heat won't reach)

**Critical Safety Rule:**
- LiFePO4 batteries CANNOT charge below 0°C (will damage cells)
- System must block charging if temperature < 0°C
- Use miner or heater to warm space before charging

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- `test_voltage_soc_converter.py` - Conversion accuracy
- `test_miner_coordinator.py` - Priority logic
- `test_hvac_controller.py` - Temperature decisions
- `test_battery_optimizer.py` - Voltage thresholds

### Integration Tests
- Test with real telemetry data (from solark.plant_flow)
- Validate against Sol-Ark specs (from Google Docs)
- Test edge cases (missing data, extreme values)
- Test preference updates (changes take effect immediately)

### End-to-End Tests
- Create user preferences via UI
- Query agent with current telemetry
- Verify agent uses user thresholds (not hardcoded)
- Update preferences, verify agent adapts
- Test all 3 agents (Manager routes correctly)

### User Acceptance Tests
- Load Solar Shack specs as defaults
- Verify matches current system behavior
- Test customization (change thresholds)
- Verify recommendations change appropriately
- Validate voltage-SOC display accuracy

## 🚨 Risk Management

### High Risk Items
**Database Migration**
- Risk: Data loss or corruption
- Mitigation: Test on staging first, full backup before prod migration
- Rollback: Keep V1.5 schema backup, can revert if needed

**Voltage-SOC Conversion Accuracy**
- Risk: Incorrect SOC display confuses users
- Mitigation: Validate against known voltage-SOC points from Sol-Ark
- Fallback: Show voltage (ground truth) prominently, SOC as secondary

### Medium Risk Items
**Agent Decision Changes**
- Risk: Agents behave differently with user preferences
- Mitigation: Populate defaults from current hardcoded values
- Testing: Extensive testing with real telemetry before deployment

**UI Complexity**
- Risk: Settings page overwhelming for users
- Mitigation: Collapsible sections, smart defaults, tooltips
- Progressive disclosure: Advanced settings hidden by default

### Low Risk Items
**API Endpoints**
- Risk: Performance impact from preference lookups
- Mitigation: Cache preferences per request, indexed queries

**Frontend State Management**
- Risk: Form state bugs (unsaved changes lost)
- Mitigation: Unsaved changes warning, autosave option
