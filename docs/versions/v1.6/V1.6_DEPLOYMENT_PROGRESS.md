# V1.6 Deployment Progress - Check-in

**Date:** 2025-10-11
**Time:** 07:07 UTC
**Status:** üü° IN PROGRESS

---

## Summary

V1.6 context management fixes are being deployed to production. Code is correct and committed, but Railway deployment was delayed. Manually triggered deployment is now running.

---

## What Was Discovered

### ‚úÖ VERIFIED: Code is Correct
- Commit: 004576a1 (pushed at 06:47 UTC)
- Solar Controller calls `get_context_files()` at line 219
- Energy Orchestrator has same pattern
- KB search function queries `is_context_file=TRUE` correctly

### ‚úÖ VERIFIED: Context Files Exist in Production
- KB Stats show: **4 context files** in production database
- Total documents: 14
- Searchable files: 10
- Last sync: 2025-10-11 02:09 UTC
- Context system is ready for V1.6

### ‚ùå PROBLEM: V1.6 Not Deployed Yet
- Production API still shows V1.5 behavior
- Agent searches KB instead of using embedded context
- Test query "What inverter?" returns KB search results
- Response shows `agent_role: "Manager"` using `search_kb_directly`

### ‚úÖ SOLUTION: Manual Deployment Triggered
- Ran `railway up --service CommandCenter` at 07:06 UTC
- Build in progress
- Expected completion: 07:11 UTC (5 min build time)

---

## Actions Taken

1. **Created deployment scripts:**
   - `railway/scripts/check_context_files.py` - Verify context files
   - `railway/scripts/create_context_doc.py` - Create context if needed

2. **Verified system state:**
   - Checked git commits (V1.6 is 004576a1)
   - Tested production API (still V1.5 behavior)
   - Checked KB stats (4 context files exist)

3. **Triggered deployment:**
   - Manual Railway deployment initiated
   - Build logs: https://railway.com/project/.../service/.../

---

## Next Steps (After Deployment Completes)

### Step 1: Verify V1.6 Deployed (2 min)
```bash
# Wait for deployment
sleep 180  # 3 minutes

# Test agent knowledge
curl -s -X POST https://api.wildfireranch.us/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What inverter are you managing?"}' \
  | jq -r '.response' | head -5
```

**Expected:** Agent mentions "SolArk 15K" directly (not KB search)

---

### Step 2: Run Validation Tests (10 min)
```bash
# Test 1: System knowledge
curl -s -X POST https://api.wildfireranch.us/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Describe your hardware"}' \
  | jq -r '.response' | head -10

# Test 2: Policy knowledge
curl -s -X POST https://api.wildfireranch.us/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What is the critical minimum battery SOC?"}' \
  | jq '.response, .agent_role'

# Test 3: Multi-turn context
SID=$(curl -s -X POST https://api.wildfireranch.us/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What is my battery level?"}' | jq -r '.session_id')

curl -s -X POST https://api.wildfireranch.us/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"message\": \"Is that safe?\", \"session_id\": \"$SID\"}" \
  | jq -r '.response' | head -5
```

---

### Step 3: Full Test Suite (60 min)
Run all 12 tests from V1.6_COMPLETION_PLAN.md:
- 4 tests: V1.5 regression (API, energy, KB, routing)
- 4 tests: V1.6 new features (knowledge, policy, context, boundaries)
- 4 tests: Performance (response time, stats, conversations, metrics)

## Timeline

| Time (UTC) | Event | Status |
|------------|-------|--------|
| 06:47 | V1.6 committed to git | ‚úÖ Complete |
| 06:50 | V1.6 pushed to origin/main | ‚úÖ Complete |
| 06:50-07:00 | Auto-deploy should have triggered | ‚ùå Did not deploy |
| 07:05 | Discovered production still V1.5 | ‚úÖ Confirmed |
| 07:06 | Manual deployment triggered | ‚è≥ In progress |
| 07:11 | Expected deployment complete | ‚è≥ Pending |
| 07:15 | Validation tests | ‚è≥ Pending |
| 07:30 | Full test suite | ‚è≥ Pending |

## Risk Assessment

### Current Risks
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Medium:** Deployment may fail (build errors)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Low:** Context files may be wrong format
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Low:** Performance may be impacted

### Mitigation
- ‚úÖ Code validated with mock tests (4/4 passed)
- ‚úÖ Context files verified in production (4 exist)
- ‚úÖ Rollback plan ready (`git revert 004576a1`)

---

## Success Criteria

V1.6 deployment is successful when:
- ‚úÖ Agent mentions "SolArk 15K" when asked about inverter
- ‚úÖ Agent answers "30%" when asked about minimum SOC
- ‚úÖ Multi-turn context works (references previous turn)
- ‚úÖ Response time <8 seconds
- ‚úÖ No errors in production logs

---

## Questions/Concerns

**Q: Why didn't auto-deploy trigger?**
A: Unknown - Railway should auto-deploy on git push. May have been delayed or failed silently. Manual deployment triggered to ensure V1.6 goes live.

**Q: What if context files are wrong?**
A: We have `create_context_doc.py` script ready to create correct context based on V1.5_MASTER_REFERENCE.md specifications.

**Q: What if performance is bad?**
A: Context adds ~3-5k tokens per request. Still well within limits (200k context window). Can optimize later if needed.
