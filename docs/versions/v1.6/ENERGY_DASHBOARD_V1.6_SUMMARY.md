## üìä Key Features

### 1. **Dual-Source Battery Monitoring**
- **Victron Data (Primary)**: Direct shunt measurements from Cerbo GX
  - State of Charge (SOC)
  - Voltage
  - Current
  - Power
  - Temperature
  - Charge/Discharge state
- **SolArk Data (Secondary)**: Inverter-level estimates for comparison
  - Automatically highlights discrepancies > 2%
  - Shows which source is more accurate

### 2. **Real-Time Power Flow Visualization**
- **Solar Production**: Current output with flow indicators
- **Battery Status**: Combined view prioritizing Victron accuracy
- **Load Consumption**: Real-time power usage
- **Grid Connection**: Import/export status

### 3. **Integration Health Monitoring**
- Live status indicators for both SolArk and Victron APIs
- Victron poller health with 24-hour reading count
- Auto-refresh every 10 seconds

### 4. **Smart Insights Engine**
- Battery health alerts (critical, low, moderate, good)
- Temperature monitoring with safety thresholds
- Solar surplus calculations
- Power flow recommendations

### 5. **Accuracy Comparison**
- Side-by-side battery metrics from both sources
- Visual badges indicating data accuracy (ACCURATE vs ESTIMATED)
- Automatic SOC difference detection with explanations

## üé® Design Highlights

### Visual Hierarchy
1. **Header** - Dashboard title + last update timestamp
2. **Health Status Bar** - Integration status for both APIs
3. **Power Flow** - 3-column layout (Solar ‚Üí Battery ‚Üí Load) + Grid
4. **Battery Comparison** - 2-column detailed cards (Victron vs SolArk)
5. **System Details** - Solar production + Grid connection
6. **Smart Insights** - Dynamic alerts and recommendations

### Color Scheme
- **Green** (#10b981): Charging, healthy states, positive actions

## üì° API Integration

### SolArk Endpoints (Existing)
```
GET /energy/latest
```
**Returns:** pv_power, batt_power, grid_power, load_power, soc, power flows

### Victron Endpoints (New in V1.6)
```
GET /victron/battery/current
GET /victron/battery/history?hours=24&limit=480
GET /victron/health
```

**Returns:** SOC, voltage, current, power, temperature, state, health metrics

---

## üöÄ Usage

### Access the Dashboard
```
https://yourdomain.com/energy
```

### What You'll See
1. **Real-time metrics** updating every 10 seconds
2. **Victron accuracy badge** on battery data (when available)
3. **SOC comparison alerts** if Victron and SolArk differ by >2%
4. **Temperature monitoring** with color-coded thresholds
5. **Smart insights** based on current system state

## üîç Data Accuracy Notes

### Why Two Data Sources?

**Victron Cerbo GX (Accurate)**
- ‚úÖ Direct shunt measurement on battery terminals
- ‚úÖ Precise current sensing (¬±0.1A accuracy)
- ‚úÖ Real-time temperature from sensor
- ‚úÖ Hardware-calculated SOC with voltage compensation
- **Use for:** Battery health decisions, charge management

**SolArk Inverter (Estimated)**
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Calculated from inverter power flow
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Estimates based on charge/discharge rates
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è No direct battery temperature sensing
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Can drift over time without calibration
- **Use for:** System-level power flow, grid export

### When SOC Values Differ
The dashboard automatically detects and highlights differences:
- **< 2% difference**: Normal variation, readings aligned ‚úÖ
- **2-5% difference**: Minor drift, monitor ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **> 5% difference**: Significant divergence, investigate üö®
