# V1.6 Update Notes

**Release Date**: October 11, 2025
**Status**: ✅ Production Deployed & Validated
**Previous Version**: V1.5.0

---

## What's New in V1.6

### 1. Embedded System Context (Primary Feature)
**Problem**: Agents had to search KB for basic system information
**Solution**: System context embedded directly in agent backstories

**Benefits**:
- Agents know system configuration without searching
- Faster responses for system-specific questions
- More accurate answers (context always available)

**Implementation**:
- 24KB of context loaded from 4 context files
- Embedded in Solar Controller and Energy Orchestrator backstories
- Includes: system specs, policies, thresholds, user profile

### 2. Intelligent Routing Refinement
**Problem**: System-specific questions were hitting KB search directly
**Solution**: Updated Manager routing logic to distinguish system vs general queries

**Changes**:
- `route_to_solar_controller` now handles system configuration questions
- `search_kb_directly` clarified for GENERAL documentation only
- Manager routes "your inverter" to agent (not KB search)

### 3. KB Fast-Path Optimization
**Problem**: Fast-Path was too aggressive, catching system-specific questions
**Solution**: Refined keyword detection to exclude system-specific patterns

**Logic**:
```python
# Only Fast-Path if general docs AND NOT system-specific
general_doc_keywords = ['manual', 'documentation', 'guide', 'how to']
system_specific_patterns = ['your', 'my', 'our', 'this system']

if is_general_doc and not is_system_specific:
    # Use Fast-Path
```

**Result**: System questions route to agents with embedded context

---

## Validation Results

### ✅ All Tests Passing

**Test 1: System Knowledge**
- Query: "What inverter model do you have?"
- Agent: Solar Controller (not KB search)
- Response: Answers from embedded context
- ✅ PASS

**Test 2: Policy Knowledge**
- Query: "What is your minimum battery SOC threshold?"
- Agent: Solar Controller (bypasses Fast-Path)
- Response: "30%" from embedded context
- ✅ PASS

**Test 3: Multi-Turn Context**
- Turn 1: "Battery is at 45 percent"
- Turn 2: "Is that safe?"
- Agent: Understands "that" refers to battery level
- ✅ PASS

**Test 4: Routing Verification**
- System questions → Solar Controller ✅
- General docs → KB Fast-Path ✅
- Planning questions → Energy Orchestrator ✅

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified
1. **railway/src/tools/kb_search.py**
   - Added comprehensive logging to `get_context_files()`
   - Track: DB connection, query results, compilation

2. **railway/src/api/routes/kb.py**
   - New endpoint: `/kb/context-test` (diagnostic)
   - Tests context loading in isolation

3. **railway/src/agents/manager.py**
   - Updated `route_to_solar_controller` tool description
   - Updated `search_kb_directly` tool description
   - Refined routing rules in backstory

4. **railway/src/api/main.py**
   - Refined KB Fast-Path keyword detection
   - Added system-specific exclusion patterns

### New Endpoints
- `GET /kb/context-test` - Diagnostic endpoint for context loading
  - Returns: success status, context length, file count, preview

---

## Performance Impact

**No Degradation**:
- Solar Controller: Still ~5 seconds
- Energy Orchestrator: Still ~13-15 seconds
- KB Fast-Path: Still ~400ms

**Improvements**:
- System questions: No longer need KB search
- Context always available (no search latency)

---

## Breaking Changes

**None** - Fully backward compatible with V1.5

---

## Known Issues

### Minor: Context Content Accuracy
- Context files say "Sol-Ark 12K" but actual system is "SolArk 15K"
- This is a data issue, not architecture issue
- Fix: Update `context-solarshack` document content
- Priority: Low (system works correctly, just wrong model number)

---

## Migration Guide

**From V1.5 to V1.6**: None required - automatic

The system auto-deployed from Railway. No database migrations, no configuration changes needed.

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. Monitor V1.6 stability in production
2. Fix context content accuracy (12K → 15K)
3. Track: response times, error rates, user feedback

### Short Term (2-4 Weeks)
1. V1.6.1: Additional context refinements
2. Add more system-specific context files
3. Improve edge case handling

### Long Term
See [V2.0_ROADMAP.md](V2.0_ROADMAP.md) for future development

## Developer Notes

### Architecture Insights

**What We Learned**:
1. Context loading wasn't the problem - routing was
2. Fast-Paths need clear boundaries (general vs system-specific)
3. Tool descriptions in CrewAI are critical for routing decisions

**Best Practices**:
- Always verify full flow (not just isolated components)
- Use diagnostic endpoints for production debugging
- Refine gradually (don't remove features, improve boundaries)

### Debugging Tools Added
1. Comprehensive logging in `get_context_files()`
2. `/kb/context-test` endpoint for isolation testing
3. Session documentation with detailed analysis

## Rollback Plan

**If Issues Arise**:
```bash
# Revert to V1.5
git revert b1717eed..9451d614
git push origin main

# Railway will auto-deploy previous version
```

**Health Check**:
```bash
curl https://api.wildfireranch.us/health
curl https://api.wildfireranch.us/kb/context-test
```
