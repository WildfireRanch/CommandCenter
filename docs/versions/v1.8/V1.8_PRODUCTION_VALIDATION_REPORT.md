   - "Try Again" functionality works

**Performance Metrics:** (From test documentation)

| Test | Target | Actual | Status |
|------|--------|--------|--------|
| 100 messages load | <100ms | ~85ms | ✅ Pass |
| 500 messages load | <200ms | ~175ms | ✅ Pass |
| 1000 messages load | <500ms | ~420ms | ✅ Pass |
| Memory growth (100 toggles) | <10MB | ~7.2MB | ✅ Pass |
| Cache hit rate | >60% | 65-80% | ✅ Pass |
| Panel animation FPS | 60fps | 58-60fps | ✅ Pass |

**Edge Case Testing:** ✅ 10 unconventional tests implemented and passing

- Large dataset performance (1000+ messages)
- Malformed data resilience
- Tab state persistence
- Responsive layout
- Reduced motion accessibility
- Race condition handling
- Zero division edge cases
- Memory leak detection

---

### Phase 5: Frontend Optimization ⏭️ RECOMMENDED (Not Blocking)

**Current Status:** Panel uses overlay mode (slides over chat)

**Recommended Enhancement:** Implement 2/3 chat + 1/3 dashboard split layout

**Priority:** Medium - Nice to have, not critical for V1.8 launch

**Recommendation:** Deploy V1.8 now, implement layout optimization in V1.9

**Implementation Plan (Future):**
1. Update chat/page.tsx to use flex layout
2. Modify ChatAgentPanel.tsx to use relative positioning
3. Add responsive breakpoints (mobile: overlay, desktop: split)
4. Test on multiple screen sizes
5. Optional: Add resize handle for adjustable width

**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours
**User Impact:** Enhanced UX, better space utilization on desktop
**Risk:** Low - can be done incrementally

---

### Phase 6: Token Optimization ⚠️ NEEDS WORK (Not Blocking)

**Current Status:**
- Target: 2,000 tokens for SYSTEM queries
- Actual: 6,024 tokens (3x over target)
- Cause: Large context files (24,012 chars total)

**Analysis:**
```
Context File Sizes:
- context-bret: 1,633 chars (~408 tokens)
- context-commandcenter: 18,735 chars (~4,684 tokens) ⚠️ TOO LARGE
- context-miner: 957 chars (~239 tokens)
- context-solarshack: 2,485 chars (~621 tokens)
Total: 24,012 chars = ~6,003 tokens
```

**Impact:**
- Current savings: 20-25% (vs target of 40-60%)
- Redis caching still provides 30-40% faster responses
- System is functional and stable

**Recommendations:**

**Option 1: Split Context Files** (Recommended for V1.9)
- Reduce context-commandcenter from 18k to 5k chars
- Move non-essential info to separate KB files
- Implement selective context loading based on query type
- Expected result: Achieve 40-60% token reduction target

**Option 2: Increase Token Budgets** (Quick fix)
```python
# In railway/src/config/context_config.py
SYSTEM_QUERY_TOKENS = 7000  # Increase from 3000
RESEARCH_QUERY_TOKENS = 8000  # Increase from 6000
```

**Option 3: Hybrid Approach** (Best for V1.9)
- Slightly increase budgets for immediate relief
- Implement selective context loading over time
- Monitor and adjust based on real usage patterns

**Priority:** Medium - System works well, optimization would improve cost savings

**Recommendation:** Deploy V1.8 as-is, optimize tokens in V1.9 based on production metrics
