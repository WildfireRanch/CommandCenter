# PURPOSE: CrewAI tools for accessing Victron Cerbo battery data
#
# WHAT IT DOES:
#   - Provides agent tools to query Victron battery metrics
#   - Returns accurate SOC, voltage, current, temperature from Cerbo GX
#   - Formats data for natural language agent responses
#
# DEPENDENCIES:
#   - crewai (agent framework)
#   - database utils (for querying victron.battery_readings)
#
# USAGE:
#   from tools.victron_tools import get_victron_battery_status
#
#   # In agent configuration:
#   tools=[get_victron_battery_status]
# ‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê

    Get accurate battery metrics from Victron Cerbo GX battery monitor.

    Use this tool whenever you need precise battery information including:
    - State of charge (SOC) percentage
    - Battery voltage
    - Battery current (charging/discharging)
    - Battery power
    - Battery state (charging, discharging, idle)
    - Battery temperature

    This data comes directly from the battery shunt and is more accurate
    than inverter-based readings.
