- Sub-second response times
- 14 documents indexed (158K tokens)

### 🎨 Professional UI Refresh

**Compressed Layout**
- 50% reduction in vertical spacing
- More data visible without scrolling
- Maintained font sizes for readability
- Uniform design across all 5 pages

**Dashboard Pages:**
1. Home - Overview with real-time metrics
2. System Health - API and database monitoring
3. Energy Monitor - Charts and power flow
4. Agent Chat - Conversational interface
5. Logs Viewer - Activity and conversation history

---

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Backend

**Manager Agent**
- Forced tool usage (no more conversational routing explanations)
- Verbatim tool output for proper metadata
- Reduced iterations (max_iter=3) for faster responses
- `allow_delegation=False` to prevent nesting overhead

**KB Search Optimization**
- Fast-path keyword detection at API level
- Bypasses Manager agent for documentation queries
- 50x performance improvement (400ms vs 20s+)
- Keyword triggers: specs, threshold, policy, manual, how-to, etc.

**JSON Metadata Parsing**
- Improved extraction of `agent_role` from responses
- Regex fallback for embedded JSON
- Better error handling and logging

### Frontend

**Data Integration**
- Home page now fetches real energy data
- Proper extraction from API response structure
- Grid export metric added to main dashboard
- 5-metric layout on Energy Monitor

**CSS Architecture**
- Uniform spacing across all pages
- Compressed vertical padding (0.75rem)
- Reduced element margins (0.5rem)
- Consistent metric card styling

---

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

**Fixed: Manager Agent Not Using Tools**
- Manager was explaining routing instead of executing
- Solution: Explicit tool usage requirements + verbatim output

**Fixed: KB Search Timeout**
- Root cause: Nested CrewAI overhead + LLM iterations
- Solution: Fast-path architecture bypasses agent chain

**Fixed: Grid Export Not Showing**
- Added `pv_to_grid` metric to Home and Energy Monitor
- Fixed API data extraction from nested response

**Fixed: Session 023 Regressions**
- Validated agent hanging fix (max_iter working)
- Confirmed graceful handling of ambiguous queries
